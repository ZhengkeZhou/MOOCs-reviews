"Too many introductory lessons that aren't useful at all. Week 1&2&3 won't teach you anything. Too much talk and not enough useful information being said. I don't really care about the personal stories of Google employees, I'm here to learn something.",1,185,bad,-1

"This course felt very basic. It could have been condensed into 2-3 weeks. The beginning concepts of data life cycle, data analysis skills, and all the material covered in weeks 1-3 could have been condensed to 1 week and weeks 4-5 material could have been condensed into another week. I don't feel like I've learned anything concrete in this course because weeks 1-3 brushes on how to think as a data analyst, and weeks 4-5 only slightly brushes on spreadsheets and SQL. In addition, I looked over the discussion forums, I don't think participation in them are helpful. It says participation is optional, but it marks me off and says that I haven't completed the entire course. The good thing is that I can watch videos in a higher speed and can fast forward to the the next weeks if I move ahead. However, I worry that the course might be dragged on and some students can lose interest. I enjoyed the stories that the different instructors shared, and can feel that they are personable people. I appreciate the work put into this! ",2,32,bad,-1

"I thought the videos were helpful in getting a basic understand of data analytics and what to look forward to. However, I was hoping to learn more from most activities. The journals and self-reflection sometimes don't give much value, although I suppose they get you thinking like an analyst a bit. When giving an introduction to spreadsheets and databases, it would be significantly more helpful if the activities were more hands on. I thought that would be the case when they introduced Qwiklabs, but no. Also, I noticed a time or two, I wasn't sure how I was supposed to input an answer, i.e. I'm sure I knew the answer, but just didn't get credit for it because of how Coursera wanted me to write it.",3,19,neutral,0

"It was an introductory course, so don't expect it to be so difficult. Videos are made very well. Tony was fine. Perhaps more questions could be provided during the videos to make sure people understand/pay attention to them. As in other Google courses, the discussions seem like a waste of time as many people skip them and there doesn't seem to be any punishment for not participating in them. Finally, it is just in the honor code that somebody writes in the journal. From a pedagogical perspective, it seems like a wasted opportunity.",5,12,good,1

I learned nothing here except some definitions I could have googled. kinda bumped and sad",1,7,bad,-1
"The course is not what I imagined it to be, throughout the course the same steps of data lifecycle are repeated over and over again.
When I saw the course I was expecting it to teach me how to think when approaching a data analysis task, it fails to do that. 
There are limited case studies spanned over 5 weeks! 
I would suggest it will be better, more useful to have the theoretical part restricted to one week and use the other four to dig deep into cases studies, say one case study each week and really take us with you through  the journey of that life cycle with proper examples. Otherwise I believe this course has failed to teach me 5 weeks worth of knowledge. ",1,6,bad,-1

"Some of the questions were odd or I believe them to be incorrect.  One of the final exam questions used 04000 as a zip code but the leading zero should probably be requested as text for '04000' in the where statement but this was counted as incorrect. Question 6 in one of the weeks asked what SELECT * did.  it says it selects all of the data from the table but that isn't quite correct, it selects all features of the data but a where clause would limit the data as well, so saying select * selects all of the data is misleading.",3,2,neutral,0

"Too heavily based on terminology which is not really used or needed in practice. Why to ask how many ""steps of data analysis"" there is? It is just your oppinions. It doesnt have to be 6. It can be easily 12 or just 4... Some questions in quizes were missleading or even wrong. For example: when you asked if ommiting certain data will lead to fair analysis. Your answer was not to check this column which is not correct. For example if you know that for some period of time, the data was not collected correctly (and you have no way of correcting this), you MUST ommit this data",1,2,bad,-1
"An utter waste of time. Instead of a course, this could have been packed in a two page PDF. No pratical takeaways or uses in real life.

"I really enjoyed this course of the Google Analytics program. It was very simple and easy to understand. I found myself know most of the concept were discussed in the course by logic, but Google Team helped to redefine the concepts in more technical way for better understand and to generalize the concepts on the real cases mentioned in the lessons. I have to admit that all the reading lessons were carefully and professionally designed and written for anyone who don't have a technical background would be able to understand. I was very satisfied with my experience in this course, and I'm looking forward for the rest of the program.",5,1,good,1
"T<U+200B>his course covers an overview  of Data Analysis topics and skills. It serves as an introduction to the larger Google Professional Certificiate program and does not always go in depth (""we'll cover that later in the course."") The real gold is in the optional, additional readings and resources which provide practical application for basic SQL, Tableau, and RStudio skills. Videos are entertaining, informative, and inspiring to hear from data analysts who are in the field. I have no experience in the field and explanations were broken down well so I was able to easily follow along.",5,1,good,1

This course covers the basic concepts of Data Analysis, it gives you the basic knowledge you need about these topics, also you will get a breif showcase of all of the tools that will be used in later courses of this certificate (SQL, Excel and Visualization). I liked that they were constantly inviting students to participate in forums and learn from others experiences and points of view.

This course provides an interesting panorama of data analysis. I believe it to be a good starting point for those pursuing this career path.

"One day of material spread over a suggested 5 weeks.  Most of the material can be cut or moved to another course about general computer and professions skills.  Is it a coincidence that they offer 14-day free trial but don't teach anything for the first 5 weeks?  Finally, parts of the course seem politically motivated, like classifying all data a ""fact"".  Instead, they should focus on teaching the material and leave their personal politics at home.",2,1,bad,-1
"I am currently studying this, much redundancy, it could give the full glossary at the beginning.  The  speakers/coaches are great, but the speech/text is overly lengthy, using points/graphics would be more efficient with the use of the speakers/coaches.  It is annoying like a fly buzz buzz, unsure if I will complete it.   So far, I just made it to Week 4, but Qwiklabs in Week 4 does not work, and so far their technical support does not give me the courtesy username/password that is supposed to be given for this Coursera course, and I am on a budget.  This course does not inspire me whatsoever.  If I do not complete it, I will ask for a full refund.",1,1,bad,-1
"I found it as supremely boring course. Same lines again & again & again & again.....I wonder whether they are checking my patience or just wasting my time. Perhaps they have strategically stretched it to 5 weeks which is basically 2-3 days course at most.

On the other hand Coursera platform itself seems okay, despite some flaws.",1,1,bad,-1

"It was an excellent entry into data analytics for someone who has never even explored the subject before. Learned a lot of the core foundations that go into data analytics but it didn't feel like it was holding my hand too much. They provided tonnes of resources and reading materials that not only helped during the first stage of the course, but that I know will help for later on. Excited to continue! I've tried online courses before and always ended up being bored or overwhelmed with the workload. The way this course is structured makes it so easy to jump in and out of and the lack of pressure from tutors and none of those screaming bold, red ""MISSED DEADLINE"" headers on your page made this a very relaxing and enjoyable course to do. I'm not one for sticking with things and completing them, but being able to jump in and out of the course any time and do whatever work whenever I wanted to do it has motiviated me to continue. Really enjoyed it!",5,0,good,1
"This course is a wide-lens view of what data analytics is and how it is done. At first I was a bit frustrated, because it felt like I wasn't learning any hard skills. But then I realized that this kind of information is really important to understand before jumping into learning about specific tools like SQL or Tableau. I needed to understand WHY I need these tools, and where they fit into the overall job of a data analyst, in order to fully appreciate and take advantage of learning in future courses. This course also served to fill in gaps in my knowledge that I didn't know that I had, such as the different between a data analyst and a data scientist. Overall, though it didn't teach me hard skills that I can put on my resume, I think that it really set me up to better understand why I am taking these courses (which will help me to stay motivated to complete the certificate) as well as make me excited about the role of an analyst in general.

"Fabulous start for a newbie. Amazing presenter - I thought he might be there throughout the full certification but only in this course one so far. There is such as wide range of topics covered in this course. It will clarify if the course is for you or not (in my case yes - huzzah!). It defines expectations and does exactly what a foundation course should do in preparing students for what is to come. It is exciting and honest-  it doesn't glamorize this industry. If you are completely new to this I would say add in a few extra hours of self learning to check out the links provided - it's worth the effort. Even if you ultimately decide data analytics is not your jam, this is still a very worthwhile all around interpretation of DA fundamentals, introducing us to a platform that affects all of us, every day, always has and always will.",5,0,good,1
"I took this course as part of the Google Professional Data Analytics Certificate and I can say this is one of the best introductory courses I've ever had. This is the introduction to data analysis that I wish I had a my first job. The basic concepts of data analysis are clearly explained and illustrated with hypothetical scenarios and examples throughout the whole course. The videos are clear and contain subtitles, so they are easier to follow if English is not your first language. There are quizzes at the end of each week so you can review all the content you learn and if you missed anything you can always go back to the content and read or watch the videos again. And the best thing is that you can do all of these at your own pace. Overall, I am very happy with the course and I look forward to finishing my professional certificate. ",5,0,good,1
"From personal experience: This Google data analytics course explains the process and gives you the scaffolding you need to use more advanced concepts. (The talking head videos from different Googlers in different fields feels like a warm environment. I still rewatch some of their tips, especially the one from Cassie.) 

Which is great in my opinion for beginners. I appreciate the synthesis of the whole process. (In other computer science and programming courses elsewhere, I felt thrown into the deep end into nitty gritty technical details that I had to idea what they were for. I'm glad we don't obsess over syntax at first). 

The con is it may lack technical depth, which is okay I think, you can learn that in many other places. Learning the basics and their appropriate context in a solid way is a great foundation.",5,0,good,1

"Overall, this is an excellent course. In my opinion, and I only speak for myself, I would like a note-taking feature that would allow me to take notes on every page, and then have a common access file link in the left column, for quick future reference of these notes. I am currently handwriting my notes, which I do not mind. Also, sometimes terms are missing in a test question, which may trip a test-taker. I might be over-thinking things, but when asked about ""business task"" in a true/false question, and it is solely described as "" the problem or data"" without the remainder or reference to "" for a business"" (as it was defined in the material), this might throw students off. Again, it may be me over-thinking things. ",5,0,good,1

In my opinion and my view, the first course in Data Analytics is very amazing and fantastic, It starts with you from the beginning and learns you everything in detail and the instructor is very directed and clear. I have learned many amazing things and knew the field of data analytics, the role of data science, tools that used in data analysis including data visualization, spreadsheets, and query language (SQL), and I have known more about stakeholders and data-driven decision-making. In the last of my feedback I thanks Coursera and Google for that fantastic and valuable opportunity.",5,0,good,1

There were a couple of questions asked on the course challenge that I don't remember learning about (specifically how to import a database into a spreadsheet). I was also confused with the first introduction to SQL, but I understood what I had trouble connecting in the following module. Other than that, really happy with the flow and content of the course.

The discussion prompts, I really don't find as effective as all the other tools, and a lot of times I ran into issues while typing up my answers. Also, since there are questions that ask about the type of visualizatios, I wish there was more information/ examples on it. Even reviewing the those subjects, I was left a little confused.

"Many times, I opt for some course, which are taught in English. I don't find problem in understanding in English. but the problem arise for me , is to depict sometimes , what they have just said. Because sometimes, tutors voice accent is a little fuzzy. and for that i had to watch whole video watching at subtitles, and just because of this problem I start to loose interest in course. But , but , but , In this Google's Course, all tutor's voice was so clear , their way of teaching was too friendly, like they were not speaking formal words time to time , they explained everything very simply. And I loved this :)",5,0,good,1
"Since I have been working in different industries and positions along my professional career, I found this a very easy course. But very interesting nonetheless. Two notes: 1) I have never worked with SQL and I haven't figured out in this course on whether the following courses will teach me SQL or if I have to learn it by myself. 2) One of the questions on the last wrap-up assignment seemed wrong to me. We had to say if =average (E:E) was the formula we had to use. I said it was false because it should have been =average(E2:E39). Maybe, you want to change this so people like me don't get it wrong. Thanks!",5,0,good,1

The quizzes and self-reflection exercises helped reinforce the knowledge and also provided additional real-life scenarios of data analytics application. Thank you!    ",5,0,good,1
"G<U+200B>reat content for zero background in data like me. The course touches on programming languages just a little, not too much, but leaves an excitement for what's next. English subtitles really help me understanding the speakers better as I'm not a native English speaker, so thumb up for that. I love to feel the energy of the speakers, but there are also times when I can feel that they are tired of speaking and recording. Anyway, analyzing data is fun, and I'll keep learning until the end. Thanks, staff team.   ",5,0,good,1
I loved this course. It is set up in a great way that introduces the concepts in a fun way to investigate and then it progresses into building some technical skills to put to use that prior knowledge. And I love how the questions on the tests are a bit sneaky in that they actually make you think with how they are worded to see if you really understand the concepts. You can't just go back and review the notes you had written down. You have to understand the material to do well. I can't wait to keep going. ,5,0,good,1

"Overall, I found this course to be a clear, well-written foundational course for setting the stage for the rest of the certificate.  Rather than just being an ""overview"" or ""survey"" kind of course, it was very good at helping me prepare with the understanding I wanted to put the ideas, tools, and other specifics in their proper context.  The videos were well produced, and the scripts helpful.  I appreciate the combination of a real person speaking, readings, activities, and quizzes.  The learning log was very important for me.  For many people, I believe that putting extra time carefully reflecting and responding to the prompts at length will be of great benefit.  To a large extent, whether a person truly does the assignment thoroughly and meaningfully is up to the student.  There is no professor to hold you accountable, because those entries are based on the honor system when you mark them off.  One key benefit of this certificate program, in contrast to just taking online skills courses is that this program is designed to help you understand the big picture, as well as how to use analytical thinking and the data analysis process.  Put another way, this program is designed to help you see the forest and the trees, and learn how to relate individual trees to the forest.  This first course is designed to introduce you to the forest, the individual trees, a map, and some practice that will prepare you for understanding what you will be doing with all the tools, and why, during the following courses, and in your future work.  The only criticisms were quite minimal.  The only annoying one was that the subtitles/transcripts seemed to be auto-generated from the audio of the video, which resulted in a lot of little errors in the text.  I suggest that a human being go through all the texts to proofread and correct them.  Some of us watch the videos and then fix everything in our learning by reading the text, too.  Thank you, Tony, and the others who contributed to making this course.",4,0,neutral,0
This was a very thorough Certificate program that will prepare you for your journey into data analytics. The only pitfall I felt after completing it was having to search for USEFUL datasets in real world examples for SPECIFIC industries that you want to apply for. ,4,0,neutral,0
"I wasn't sure at first how I felt about just how gentle and slow this course is, with lots of encouragement and repetition. I've taken a few days since completing it to think about whether or not I want to go forward with the rest of the certificate and I think I'm sold. The goal of the repetition and open-book model and gentleness seems to be to get participants to just go forward successfully. Getting to a level of familiarity at which one can put the knowledge into practice is what really sticks it, after all. While these factors slow the course down a bit, they also make it friendly and make the upcoming, more technical material completely approachable. There's always 2x video speed to turn up the jazz with as well, and I love all the other options and benefits of learning in this format. It allows for sequential, structured, yet self-paced learning on a completely flexible schedule. Coursera's navigational sidebar provides a constant visual on place and progress in the course as well as a constant reminder and foreshadowing of content, which I find extremely helpful for mental organization and having a big-picture on the learning project. The content is getting more interesting as I begin playing with the second course.",4,0,neutral,0
"Greatings Coursera. Thanks for providing me access to this great course. I have some previous knowledge, but I know how someone who learns about the topic for the first time will feel about it. I like the friendly speakers and the main host amoung them Tony. I like the basic introduction and the putting the general idea behind the whole area of data work. Some elements needed more practice, making the learners think in details about the topics they know so little about it isn't working so successful (just check the forums answers). I suggest solution. Have the the study material summarized in text after the video, so the viewer can recall what they have heard. I like the ""Glossary"", but I will love something that is not only about Letters and few terminology, let this cheat sheet expand. You will say that is best for the learners to do so, and you will be right! But if we want as many people to have that knowledge at their disposal in short and compact format for easy learning, then why not?",4,0,neutral,0
"The course was well-presented, but I think the section about job search should come after the Course Challenge Graded Quiz, instead of right before. It threw me off to start focusing on job search activities and future plans, rather than specifics about the content related to data analysis. ",4,0,neutral,0
"T<U+200B>he intro course is great for figuring out what on earth data analysts actually do, what processes and instruments they use, and what the challenges they face look like. It introduced some instuments, but  teaches nothing beyond the most rudimentary skills. As someone who is still figuring out whether the field is for them, I loved it. I also regret not doing it during the free trial period and paying ￡30 for it, as it can be completed within a couple of days. Personally, it took me 3 evenings to get through. So if you are considering it - go for it, set out some time during the free week, finish it quickly and move on. 
I realise I might come of as critical, but I am really, really not. It's a solid intro with incredible lecturers, and it covers a wide variety of topics and makes you think of things you have never considered about data analysis. I don't think anyone but complete beginners (like me!) would need it, but I am very happy it exists. ",4,0,neutral,0
"Tony was great in providing a gentle introduction to data analytics. The course tries to specify exactly what the specialization is trying to be and rationalize our expectations, so that's great. Coming from an engineering background myself, I did not expect journaling or course discussions to be of much help, but they actually contributed to a better understanding of the source material since I consciously made an effort to engage in them. Areas of improvement could be that some glossary terms could be better defined (""Data analytics"" is the science of data but ""Data science"" is something else?), and no use providing incomplete glossaries at the end of each week. Also, the course challenge has answers in the immediately next question so it sort of defeats the purpose. Other weekly challenges also could be more challenging.",4,0,neutral,0
"I think this is a great start for people who are completely unfamiliar with the world of data or business terminology. I would say that there was a really high emphasis on the glossary. I appreciate how simple and accessible the knowledge is, but it also didn't make me very confident in what I might be learning in future courses. My favorite part of the course was actually the puzzle quiz. I wish there was a more exhaustive and extensive version of that so you can see you might rank with actual data analysts (and other professions) based on your performance. That would be incredible and validating to a certain degree. I look forward to the next 7 courses, but I am incredibly skeptical about how applicable these skills actually are (I'm a regretting not taking Discrete Mathematics instead).",4,0,neutral,0
"I like the overall course, however there are parts of it that are not well enough touched on for testing expectations. For example, which data visualization would be best for a specific scenario is very lightly touched on and yet is the final question of the Foundations quiz. Another example is SQL. While SQL is an easy programming language to learn, this course should offer more practice to users to help them drill and understand the SQL schema. I have prior experience with this language, but I could see a beginner struggling with this section. That being said, many of the questions and expectations in this course are pretty light and give enough context and guidance for the user to figure it out. Offering a few more ways to practice each section would raise my review.",4,0,neutral,0
"I am now confident that I have a foundation of what data analytics is all about and I have been able to see just how important I can benefit from these skills in developing my current career in public health and research.  Knowing that I can benefit from this course in my career, I have decided to complete this program and earn the certificate. ",4,0,neutral,0
"N<U+200B>ice introduction course! Really liked Tony as instructor) Very motivating content to become Data Analyst!
What i didn't like - reflection tasks - i tried to complete reuirement for length (100-200 words) and then saw that the most of learners didn't comply to this. 
for me it's hard to wright in English, as it's not my native language, that's one of ther root causes I didn't like this assignements. 
But those peers, who wrote as many words as me)) - it's great imputs to get more information about this field and people who want to be Data ANalyst , just like as I, from all over the world.",4,0,neutral,0
"This course was really nice, it definitely provided a lot of information on the foundations of the Data Analytics field, but I do feel like there is room for improvement. For example, some of the coursework seems a little disjointed, and some of the quizzes ask questions about stuff that was not covered to the extent that the question asks. For instance, there was a question about the best sort of chart to use for visualization in a certain scenario, but they didn't go over the individual types of charts, or the appropriate data sets to use for each one, so I ended up making a guess more than using any knowledge I learned. Overall, I think it was a decent course, though, and I look forward to continuing the program.",4,0,neutral,0
"I was an ok introduction, some of the tests asked me to answer questions I did not run into in the lectures or readings. Not sure if this was on purpose but it happened with many questions. Also some of the videos telling me I'm doing a good job, this praise seems unnecessary and for it to come out of a recording makes it unauthentic as anyone pressing the play button will hear this, it's not based on me actually doing a good jobs. I feel like a 4-year old being told ""good job."" Other than that, it was pretty good. I felt like I could tell the main person speaking in the videos was reading while the others were just speaking. I prefer to watch videos where it's not scripted.",4,0,neutral,0
"This course is very  useful and helpful for every beginner and advanced  aspirants who haven't knowledge about the data analytic  and from this course will truly understand about what we can do in upcoming course and get knowledge about the roles of data analysis and how useful and we can relate this course to day to day life . through this we get a lot of knowledge about the dimensions of data analytics , what are the phases of data analysis and their use and roles  in ecosystem .i would give you one suggestion if recommend my suggestion that you should also give some practical knowledge so that aspirants can understand more easier this effective course.",4,0,neutral,0
"One of the answers for the Course Assignment is incorrect. I have tried to look for contact info to address this as I got a point deducted even though either the question has been incorrectly worded or there has been an oversight in the solution. Two issues: first, this is a graded assignment (which counts if you're going for the pro certificate) and which will unfairly penalize students for selecting the correct answer; second, there's no contact information or at least an option where students could easily and intuitively raise these type of issues and concerns. Otherwise, and overall, the course is a good introduction to the program.",4,0,neutral,0
"The course was pretty good for an introductory course. I find the forum though not as valuable because since everyone is taking the course at different times. Also because there are so many people, it seems difficult to have any kind of back and forth. If you create a post and someone comments whether it's a positive or negative reply, the discussion seems lost. As far as the quizzes and challenges for multiple choice, if you get a question incorrect, the message should be you got it wrong without giving the answer. That would force the student to work toward finding the right one.",4,0,neutral,0
Enjoyed the course; well put together.,4,0,neutral,0
"I thought I could learn practical skills related to spreadsheets and SQL, but it was too basic skills and most of the courses consisted of reading that wants us to understand Data Analytics first. It is a good structure of introductions. But I think Google should clearly notice us that this one 5 weeks course is part of another 6 courses. Maybe I didn't read table of contents clearly. But It would be great if it is more clear. Over all, I'm satisfied with this course. It was easy to approach as a beginner in the data industry. I'm looking forward to learning the next courses!",4,0,neutral,0
I<U+200B>t is a grest course that provides a well balanced selection of course material and support for students. The presentations are good and follow a logical learning patern. There are also guides to help you study and to improve your learning skills which is excellent. I also like the discussion about how the course can help you identify personal strengths and how they may help you find a job.,4,0,neutral,0
"I<U+200B> really enjoyed the very personable approach of the course led by the instructor Tony.  The course was well constructed and balanced simple and complicated concepts.  The SQL portion was a little bit rushed and not as straight forward as the rest of the lesson.  For example, there were alot of SQL commands thrown into conceptual parts of the lesson that made it a bit hard to follow.  Also, please improve the glossary.  It only captures a small portion of the needed definitions that were presented in this course.",4,0,neutral,0
I am generally happy with the Foundations Course. It was a great Introduction into the Data analysis world at large. A lot was covered and the challenge will be to make it all stick. Continuous application in both business and personal life would be the key determining factor. Some more practical examples which one can use for practice would also help a lot. The quizzes and weekly challenges also added a lot of value as one went along. All this talks to benefits realization as well. I guess the same would go for all the subsequent courses as well. ,4,0,neutral,0
"Great introductory course to Data Analytics. The instructors and the course material provides explanations in great detail about such topics as the life-cycle of data and the data analysis process steps. Also the course provided some useful links; I especially enjoyed reading the material on the research conducted in the people analytics field. I think, though, that the course could have been shorter; it did feel drawn out a bit too much, with some topics repeating over and over, and could have been condensed to maybe 2-3 weeks.",4,0,neutral,0
"The course was great at covering the basics and general knowledge. I don't know where else to mention this, but in the Course Challenge exam, there were a few errors with Question 4. Finding the average of all the values in Column E does not give the average total store sales of Splashtastic. Instead, it gives the average total store sales of all products.

"I enjoyed the  material of this course a lot. The presentation of the material could be improved upon using better presentation tools like  power point slides and a side by side video of the instructor explaining things rather than just having a the instructor read the material off a teleprompter. Also the threads in the discussion forum are hard to track. Since its an open course with people completing it at their own pace, if you click the track this post, you get emails about responses in the discussion for days and weeks after you've completed it and  moved on. Discussion posts need to be re -thought so that you get to read responses for 3-4 days  at the most after you post to a discussion /self refection post. One can always go back and read all responses voluntarily in their free time.",3,0,neutral,0
"The course is targetted towards new comers but a few parts of the course are quite technical and requires someone with previous knowledge of the tools that are being explored such as sql query writing and sheets formulas. 
Also the assesment is too theoritical which is challenging for people who are not proficient at english, my suggestion would be to either limit the theoritical questions or to have a translation option for a variety of languages so those who dont have english as a first language can easily answer the question.",3,0,neutral,0
" course to begin with data analytics, but can be improved further more by adding more details/depth to each topic. Moreover as we saw in the course that data visualization lays a vital role in understanding the problem and its solution, which I saw was missing in most of the Tony's presentation of examples. If the examples would have been dealt in more detail and graphically/visually, it would had been a easy sailing. But Instead tony was just standing and narrating through the written script. It was more like news reading that explaining and making people understand.",3,0,neutral,0
Great overall. Easy to follow and reintroduces the concepts to reinforce learning. ,3,0,neutral,0
"So tedious... nothing but definitions and questions you that have to look back to be able to answer due to the deviations on how it is presented. Be more direct, this isn't rocket science. Only one of the weeks offered any actual 'hands on' training and at that it was minimal. I hope there is more hands on work coming up! It could be that I am biased as I work with data regularly in my current job and this is a bit 'no brainer', sorry! I maybe should have considered the fast track option but was scared to due to my job title not being technically a data analyst...",3,0,neutral,0
"This first Course held a lot of information but the problem came when taking the tests. I feel like most of the questions asked were based on topics that were skimmed over in the lessons. To better improve the course the important topics should go more into depth, show more visulas and actually focus on topics rather than giving multiple brain breaks in the lesson. It makes it difficult to study and focus on the important material. There should be more focus on Data Visualization and Data Cleaning. Overall the course was good but it could be better. ",3,0,neutral,0
The course was informative and give an good introduction on data/data analysis however I did not enjoy several aspects of the course.  The first being that not enough printed materials were available to use as study materials.  and the most frustrating aspect of the course is that the assessment questions on several occasions did not match the material taught within the lesson or had never even been mentioned.  I find this unfair and irresponsible to assess on material(s) that has never been presented or presented in a vague manor. ,3,0,neutral,0
"The course did introduce me to what to expect and how to do majority of tasks.
Sadly the course would repeatedly state how you will learn later or repeats a point made in previous lessons . This course also poorly communicated that there was more courses to come for data analyst. During some quizzes there were some questions that were talking about things not covered and looking at post-test reviews would direct you to  a non-existent lesson or lessons that gave too much of general term for any specifics that were asked.",3,0,neutral,0
"I hate I do not get the right answers when I fail a quiz question , but I have to rewatch a whole video where people talk slowly and I can not adjust the speed. ( at least you can read the text..) This is an introductory course, but still I personally prefer it to have more data* and less in general talk. The good bit: very excited to learn sql. So far the course managed to make get me from 'curious to motivated', giving me small successes even though I had zero knowledge regarding sql previously.
Regards,
J",3,0,neutral,0
"I think this course could be shorter than 5 weeks! By adversiting it as a 5 weeks course with a certificate, it makes you think it will capacitate the student to the job market, but sadly, it won't. You can finish it all in 2-3 weeks tops and won't learn the most fundamental data analysis skills and techniques, such as cleaning data and analysing it. The videos and materials focus too much on training you to have the mindset of a data analyst, which is useful, but not enought to land your first job.",3,0,neutral,0
"Creo que como introduccion es demasiado larga y repetitiva, algunas preguntas de los cuestionarios son demasiado concretas y se refieren a estructuras arbitrarias y no creo que aporten mucho valor ni evaluen bien lo aprendido. El curso me parecio demasiado descriptivo. En algunos momentos parecia mas propanganda para convencer a alguien en convertirse en analista que ofrecerme contenido de valor concreto para trabajar. Espero que los siguientes modulos ofrezcan mas contenido aplicable.  ",3,0,neutral,0

"Some things needed further instruction, like SQL language.  I kept getting code writing questions wrong even though I wrote the code like the www.w3schools.com/sql links and the limited instruction in the course had.  It would have been nice to see what the right answer was instead of just telling me it was wrong over and over.  Also the qwiklabs left a lot to be desired.  The instructions were vague and there were a lot of technical issues.",3,0,neutral,0
Some of the material was very repetitive and in the process terms kept changing making it a bit confusing to learn.,3,0,neutral,0
"There is one question in the ""final"" that references AVERAGE (C?:C??) of which I cannot remember the actual function reference. Because I'm used to Excel, AVERAGE is not the nomenclature (it's AVG)... I got the question wrong... I knew the essence of what was being asked but the function reference is different. Could you please either give a heads up (in Google vs. Excel) or go both ways on the answer.",3,0,neutral,0
"The foundation course goes over data, what it is, and how it is used. Foundations - got it. But, there are also parts where they quiz the student on SQL and spreadsheet formulas that are not well covered in the course. Also, 5 weeks worth of work for the foundation course does not feel worth all the time I spent on it.  I will most likely stop there and not waste more of my time or money. ",3,0,neutral,0
"So much of this was about what it is to be a data analysist, not HOW to be a data analyst.  And please, don't indoctrinate me into 'inclusion' and 'fairness' when you're supposedly talking about the ethics of data analysis.  You said the data may be true, but not inclusive.  But you used this as not being inclusive of women in some way, not in light of including all the data.  Please.",3,0,neutral,0
"Content of this course is really good. However, my concern is about the way it has been organized and presented. ",3,0,neutral,0
"I<U+200B> learned the most in week 4 and 5. Although in these weeks, I was hoping that there would be more explaintion on excel graphs and google visualization. Also, there was no intro to R as I had anticipated. Also, I did not know this was 1 class out of 8. There are several classes to go when learning the material. I hope the technical material is not taught too late in the process. ",3,0,neutral,0
"Fairly basic foundational stuff; outside of the introduction to SQL clauses, most people with office experience will know most if not all of it. Suggest revising your 90% threshold on the pretest down a bit; I scored 85% and was bored through most of it. Also, recommend running the course transcripts past a human editor/QA; many are mispunctuated and some ""mishear"" the video. ",3,0,neutral,0
"There were a lot of repetitions and little information. I'll continue this course hoping that I'll learn something new every lesson but if I knew this one was an introduction about the job I'd have started from the second one. I think that this was a mistake I made not reading carefully the course description. 
I liked the videos, the fact that there were people speaking. ",3,0,neutral,0
I<U+200B> understand having the background information but because I have already started coding and taking courses outside of this it became really repetitive and was hard for me to get through. If I am completely honest I am one of those people who cannot stand having to sit through information I already know and try to memorize it along with new information I should know.,3,0,neutral,0

"It's definitely what I would expect from a Google course. Questions on test are often somewhat true, but then according to the test actually false. Typical Googlese tests. Pretty well done, but the spreadsheets and SQL introduction were downright painful. Would've been nice to skip straight to the test and bypass the parts I already know well.",3,0,neutral,0
The part 1 of 8 was very basic emphasizing on the terms. It intended to be an introduction but was very lengthy. some videos don't add anything to the learner knowledge. some quizzes had tricky answers and wasn't really tested the knowledge obtained. Not very practical and hands on exercises. Hopefully it gets better along the way.,3,0,neutral,0
The course is an introduction to the data analytics field and for someone with any prior experience it will be too basic. The idea of sharing Google employees' experiences to get the students interested and the presenters' performance are very nice but all up until the 4th week there is not much to involve in and start learning. ,3,0,neutral,0
"A pleasant but lengthy introduction to the field of data analysis. The course's emphasis is on how to think as a data analyst and on what differentiates data analysis from other data-centric jobs. Practically no technical skills are covered, and I'm hopeful they will be taught in-depth in the following courses.",3,0,neutral,0
I don't really learn via videos. I would rather have more case studies and review sheets.,3,0,neutral,0
"I found the lack of power-point teaching style is a bit nuisance and a bit difficult for me to remember things.

" This course covers the very basics, with tiny introductions to skills such as SQL. As I have a strong background in general analytical thinking and experience working with spreadsheets much of this course was review. However, I was glad to learn certain ideas specialized for Data Analytics.",3,0,neutral,0
"The course was good as in informing me in what I need to learn. However, I didn't think that I learned much. There was a lot of talk about things I would describe as common sense. I also thought the quizzes were too easy. I probably could have passed them without even taking the course.",3,0,neutral,0
"I don't agree with some of the answers to the quizzes. Sometimes it feels that technical content is missing in the videos. Some relevant topics in today's data analysis were completely ignored: spreadsheets importance was overemphasized, forgetting unstructured databases and big data.",3,0,neutral,0
Considering the course was introductory was expecting few hands on experience in all the tools we would be using in the upcoming lessons. Also felt the videos and stories were quite elaborate. And what I felt is instead of journal entry could have included few hands on activities ,3,0,neutral,0
"It seems at times the questions that appear on a quiz can be a bit leading, or asked in such a way that it is difficult to understand what is actually being asked. Overall, I think things are good, but sometimes the language used does not seem as precise and dialed in.",3,0,neutral,0
"Interesting material with a solid theoretical foundation. I am mostly fond of the data analysis process, date lifecycle, gap analysis, SQL/spreadsheets, and visualization toolkit. I would have liked some hands on experience with SQL and material on business analytics. ",3,0,neutral,0
"the course was really great but the certificate I got has a grammatical mistake in the spelling of my name as it is EKTA MANGAL, not some EXTAMANGAL MANGAL, this mistake happened the first time with me on Coursera so i am disappointed with the certificate I got only.",3,0,neutral,0
"There were some nice basics, but all in all, most of the topics where purely theoretical and there was not much to apply anything. I hope there is more to learn in the next courses since I dont think it helps much in the real world to just know terms and definitions.",3,0,neutral,0
"Do not know how the remaining courses are going to be like, but we have touched spreadsheets and sql and there was no indepth. it was majorly links to go read up on.",3,0,neutral,0
"The notes in the course should be more concise and summarised. Many of the notes were in the long transcripts of the videos, which doesn't help to reinforce learning, and isn't the most efficient way for students to quickly access information. ",3,0,neutral,0
"<U+200B>Because people are taking this course to see if a data analytics career is right for them, more focus should be on those topics that separate those for whom data analytics is a good career from those for whom data analytics is a bad career.",3,0,neutral,0
"The general information in course is OK, I got basic understandings of what I will be learning.",3,0,neutral,0
it could go deeper into how to rite commands to retrieve information. and a better understanding how to use spreadsheets. i would say more practice on spreadsheets. how do you go to the other courses accocieated with this data course,3,0,neutral,0
"Seemed very shallow. Quizzes sometimes had misleading wording, but were also pretty shallow. Hopefully, the next courses will be better with a greater focus on technical skills. I'm worried that it won't be all that interactive.",3,0,neutral,0
"The course was okay, the difficulty level could be turned up a little. But as someone who has always been interested in data but had no formal training and a little real world experience, it was a good little exercise. ",3,0,neutral,0
"Overall good however the labs were somewhat problematic and I will have to repeat most of them or find another resource to really get the intent of them. Instructions that didn’t match, flashed too quick, bad links. ",3,0,neutral,0
"Capstone was in my opinion was a bit confusing. I wish throughout the entire course we could've been working on a bit of our capstone within each module, so by the end we would be able to put it all together. ",3,0,neutral,0
Overall an interesting opening segment to cover the big picture stuff involved in data analysis.  Found the amount of content designed to keep me motivated quite tedious and felt like it was wasting my time.,3,0,neutral,0

"<U+200B>This course is just honestly isn't very helpful. The video delivery is slow-paced and boring, the content feels unsubstantial and unnecessary, the quizzes are overly simplistic and textbook-ish, and I consider the entire section on fairness and inclusivity to be counter-productive and extremely questionable. This course leaves a bad first impression, and I hope the rest of the courses aren't like this. To be fair, I did learn about a few new terms and concepts, but I honestly don't think these add any more value than simply learning these concepts on the job.

After many hours working through the first two courses, only midway through this second course did I actually do something - create a spreadsheet, perform some functions and formulas and make a dashboard. Otherwise, these lessons have been mostly just watching talking head videos and then answering multiple choice quizzes. Very disappointing, and a terrible way to learn something new. The program so far feels very padded, as if the creators knew they didn't have much content and wanted to find ways to stretch the material they have. The rudimentary nature of some of the content is surprising. Maybe Google could take for granted that anyone signing up for this certificate already knows what ""data"" is, as well as ""the cloud,"" and wouldn't need these terms to be defined and quizzed? In the second course, far too much time is spent ""teaching"" proper email etiquette and how to behave during a meeting! At best this should have been optional reading fo those who feel they need it. Way too much time is spent simply regurgitating definitions of terms. It's almost laughable to watch a 5 min video of someone introducing general concepts on a topic, answer a short quiz, and then have the next video begin with someone congratulating me on having learned all about the previous topic. ",2,47,bad,-1
"This certificate program is not cutting it. It feels as if Google created a Google doc and asked their entire company to compile a curriculum. Fuzzy overlapping ideas, meandering, droning, endlessly repeating. The material is primarily delivered by ""talking heads"" through video. You will rarely engage in actual technical work or use statistical tools for applied analysis. This is a shame because the great power and utility of state-of-the-art statistical tools is what brings people into Data Science in the first place. Instead, you will hear a lot of stories and manufactured examples of how Googlers and Nooglers (whatever that is) have found success in their practice. Data analysis at Google is a far cry from what data analysts encounter in the broader business world. This is a punishing, miserable experience thus far that will have you feeling like you have spent hours upon hours listening to a seminar without acquiring any technical skills (consider this a review of the first and second course in the 8 course curriculum).",2,26,bad,-1
"I really expected more out of a course from Google. I don't even know where to start in outlining what was not up to standards. It seems clear that there is not a skilled educator involved in designing this course or the certificate program in general. This is more a forum for googlers to tell us a few things about what it is like to work as a data analyst rather than actually teaching the necessary skills of data analysis. Why on earth should we be learning about how to be considerate in our meetings as data analysts before we actually learn about data analysis? Honestly this is shameful. Do better, Google.",1,22,bad,-1
"This course provides a decent overview, but it too often references terms that it either hasn't explained or hasn't discussed in enough detail. For example, the distinction between primary and secondary stakeholders is not made very clear, but one of the tests expects the test taker to have more information than has been taught. Another example is that a number of more advanced spreadsheet functions are shown, but the material doesn't make it clear that we're not expected to know that information yet.",2,19,bad,-1
"The course gives a great overview on how a data analyst thinks, poses questions and prepares their work to start a task on the right path. It also contains useful information on what to do in conflict situations, who to contact and how to politely react and communicate, which I found very valuable. My main problem with the courses so far is that they feverishly focus on definitions. The way concepts are explained are very lacking and dry. They are in desperate need of visuals such as graphs, animations and screen captures. All these topics can be perfectly shown visually, so I can't understand the decision to almost exclusively have someone talking to a camera. The people are sympathetic, but all these concepts are abstract! There's a bit of an irony considering we learn that preparing data to stakeholders in a way they can grasp the information is important. So why not treat the students the same way?The course challenge felt out of place and didn't really build on what we've learnt. It's strange we're focusing so hard on definitions and glossaries, but end up only needing an alarmingly shallow end-test to pass the course. It would profit from a timed exam that has far more questions and that actually makes the student utilize the provided spreadsheets, rather than having it all pre-chewn, only to peek at and ticking one of 4 boxes. Otherwise this course is set on the right foot. It's all there! But the execution feels very lacking and disappointing. Dear Google Team, your work so far has been soooo great and I'm absolutely grateful you provide this opportunity, but this course definitely needs a lot more polish!",2,13,bad,-1

This is by far one of the worst online courses I have ever taken. The fact that this has been developed by Google makes it even worse. I have learned nothing that I can say will help me in data science and I honestly feel cheated. I don't recommend this course to anybody and I consider it a complete waste of time.,1,8,bad,-1

All information presented is very basic and repetitive. The tests and challenges are very easy and predictable.It seems this course was made for people who just finished high school and never had any professional experience. I hope it gets better on course number 3. ",1,2,bad,-1
"This course had a lot of great real-life examples which helped see actual applications of the concepts in this course - excellent intro to Excel formulas and functions, including errors and fixes!   I also loved the SMART framework for questions! In the past I have used the SMART framework for goals and it makes a lot of sense to use it for questions too.   The section on stakeholders provided additional insight and good advice (e.g., do not be afraid to say no, focus on the objective) although the course challenge questions on the primary vs. secondary stakeholders were a bit confusing. I also found the advice on teamwork, meetings and conflict resolution very useful.  Having the information broken into smaller chunks (e.g., 5-minute videos) was very helpful. The periodic short quizzes and flashcard exercises were very useful and helped the knowledge sink in.   Overall, very enjoyable and informative course!",5,1,good,1
"The instructor was natural and enthusiastic, like most Google instructors. I think for the information presented, she was fine. As for the content of the course, I know that there was important information presented; however, it seemed like they didn't have enough content for this course, so they introduced a lot of other topics. They are important. I just think that most people are looking forward to learning specific skills with spreadsheets and databases and less soft skills. Like I said, though, the soft skills are important to. In sum, this is still just an introductory course and will probably be quite easy for most people.",5,1,good,1
"After getting midway through the course that immediately follows this one, I decided to revise upwards my rating of the ""Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions"" course.

However, the analytical pace does pick up and I can now better appreciate the value of this course.  ",5,1,good,1

"Multiple times throughout the course I encounter a part that gives me the feeling ""Now we're gonna get our hands dirty! We finally get to the meat of the course and get to practice data analysis!"" Turns out, this course is just like the previous one: 80% conceptual. Even simple things like creating pie charts are done for us. This gives me the impression that the course was created and designed by googlers and data analysts but not tested by beginners. I take issue with the idea that Google is using us new students as the front loaders for a new and more successful version of the course. I paid for an excellent education and I'm not even gonna get the whole thing because I live outside of the USA.Emotion aside, data analysis is a very rhythmic discipline. When performing analysis on a data set, there are subroutines and repeating actions you need to perform on any data set and I firmly believe the course should give us more than one repetition of how to perform these routines or else they'll produce graduates with spotty abilities and holes in their game. And please don't say ""it's your responsibility to practice so and so out of our course"" - we're frickin' paying for this course, it should get us at the very least to adequate, not barely-practiced but chock full of concepts. In fact, since this course has Google's backing, adequate seems like a low bar to clear.Google's aim for this shouldn't just be to provide students with information, but to structure the course and educate such that their graduates will calmly and assertively navigate and process their first data set using things they learned from google.To use a metaphor, when you see Mike Tyson box, all those movements are textbook movements drilled into him by Cus d'Amato - not a single step, twist, or punch from the boxer is anything but the moves drilled into him by his maestro. The mind of the teacher has been transplanted wholesale into that of the student and this informs their behavior and choices. ",3,1,neutral,0
"A little disappointed with this one. This seems to be geared very heavily to the type of mandatory HR homework you have to do when you're actually hired. I think it's harmful to teach this as a course, because each data analyst position and environment is different. Maybe this is the way it works at Google, but it certainly doesn't have to - it just seems incredibly basic and honestly kind of condescending. I was hoping that the ""Ask Questions for Data-Driven Decisions"" course would have a lot more case study work that actually makes us think of real world problems and how to approach them from the perspective of data research (not what is the appropriate email response to a supervisor who expected a report not to be late). Come one, Google, really? ",2,1,bad,-1
This can apply to both course #1 & #2. But they're both incredibly basic (I missed the cutoff to skip by 1 point) and that made it a real slog to get through. The readings are a bit lacking and the connection between Coursera and Qwiklabs is very hit or miss. ,2,1,bad,-1

To be honest, i wasn't able to catch up with what context in a course mean and see a whole forests in the process of the course. However, i practiced what i had learned over and over so that as taking steps, i became as much understanding of context of ASK phase and importance of it in an initial state as repeated it.Above all, for the instructors who lead us to the right direction, i appreciate them and many many thanks and back to them whenever i want to review or see them.Bye,Kevin Song  ",5,0,good,1

It was also extremely helpful that the design of the new information was always presented in a manner that real-world applications.  ",5,0,good,1
"I appreciated how this program walked you through the specifics of spreadsheets etc, but I wish, at some points during the spreadsheet learning, they would explain exactly what each aspect of functions do.

After following instructions and getting the answer I still was confused how where got there, I didn't know what the ""$"" meant, and I had no clue where the 2, and 0 came from or what they meant.

"A great course to understand ""how to ask a question?"" Well I think the processes explained here about asking question is not limited for data analysis but I think these are equally important for resolving any issue in our professional as well as personal life. The way you ask the question will definitely help you to find a great solution for any of you problems. Team building, working under pressure, meeting deadlines all these aspects are beautifully explained which will be very useful once we start our real professional journey of data analysis, well again I think this aspects are equally important for any other professions.",5,0,good,1

"This course gives a very comprehensive foundation on the soft skills that are required to a Data Analyst. Quite frequently new learners focus only on the hard skills, how many softwares they know, level of fluency in programming languages, etc. However what really makes someone stands apart from the croud, is a very good set of soft skills.

Excellent beginners level introduction.  Would be useful to add additional gates/fasttrack options for those who already have sufficient skills.  I understand that there is a fast-track but even after scoring 90% on the screening test I still felt it was better to complete all aspects of the course as it didn't provide a personalised area for me to focus on.  Could the learning objectives be broken down further to allow users to choose which sections to focus on if they don't get perfect score in the initial test?,5,0,good,1

"Excellent course, excellent instructor. THE GOOD: the instructor, Ximena, provided examples throughout of how a concept was applied in the real world, which made it (the concept) easier to grasp. As always, the hands-on approach mixed with the rest of the material really enhanced the learning experience. Illustrations of form, such as the one for an email, was great and more of that should be provided for beginners to take with them and use & develop as part of their own tool kits moving forward.  WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED: how questions in quizzes and challenges are worded. I got dinged in a challenge because according to your site I got the answer wrong; however, the question is not clearly worded which led me to answer incorrectly. This is the second time this type of incident has occurred as it happened in the first course, and what's worse is that there's no communication avenue where I can reach out to and raise this concern. I take this course seriously as it is about my career what is affected, so scores and outcomes in marked challenges do matter to me. I still have not heard from the first time I raised my concern which was extremely difficult to connect with someone here on Coursera. Secondly, there should be material relating to the readings that can easily be downloaded for the student's future reference; at the moment I see some documents like forms and glossary, which is great, but nothing relating to the discussions in the videos. Videos are fantastic but notes that supplement these discussions could go a long way. Otherwise, this has been a great course delivered by a fantastic instructor and in a very professional way. Kudos Coursera/Google! ",4,0,neutral,0
"I've found that a lot of the interview videos tend to be more like filler than providing anything useful. I'd say watch them, but you don't need to take notes on them, and I speed up the audio on those to about 1.25-1.50 where I can still understand it but don't need to take notes on it. Since most of the lecturers/interviewees speak very slowly it really just brings it up to a normal speaking speed. I've also found that the Qwiklabs is really buggy-- when I try to open the sheet to do the work, instead it just opens up a new copy of the dashboard thing, and it often takes me a minimum of 10 tries to get it to actually open a sheet. Also, the last quiz before the final course quiz is weird-- there's one question that is about what to do with results that are outside the statistical norm, and the reading they direct you to doesn't actually answer the question they ask about it, at least not as far as I can tell. I had to go and search for the answer on my own, and even then I had to redo that quiz multiple times just to get that one answer correct because the reading was so vague and unhelpful. If you're going to have a question like that on the quiz, you need to be certain that it is answered clearly in the readings or videos.I'm trying to remain motivated to do this course though.",4,0,neutral,0
"I<U+200B> had a harder time paying attention to the instructor because her style of reading the script was a little unnatural to me (a bit sing-song-y), where her voice continually had an upward inflection at the end of sentences and some of the emphasis of the words made the word seem unrecognizable for a second and then I'd catch up with the lecture.  To me, the effect was the content felt juvenile, since the presentation was that saccharine. To combat this, I read the script most of the time and that helped, but it was the biggest factor of not wanting to continue with this course. She seems qualified and lovely as a person, but I truly hope I'm not instructed by her again.W<U+200B>ith regard to the content, some of this was a review and it was still nice to catch some new tips and tricks along the way. I don't always feel the quizzes are testing my knowledge enough. While I get some questions wrong, I feel like the reason is due to not matching an exact phrase to a lesson, rather than not getting it correct because I was proving I know how to make a chart or how to calculate what's being asked. I just hope my good grades aren't reflecting a few memorized definitions, and indicative of my ability to perform the analysis I've been taught.",4,0,neutral,0
"I think the instructor was really well organized and delivered the material professionally. The material and delivery were clear and well-scripted. Kudos to Coursera for their part in this course so far. In fact, if I was only rating Coursera, I would give this 5 stars. However, Quiklabs does not live up to Coursera's standards as far as I'm concerned. There are disconnects between instructions and how the Quiklab actually behaves.  I consider myself an intermediate when it comes to technology, but when I start talking to myself after following directions religiously and still have problems I lose patience and find myself getting annoyed. You might want to focus on a more seamless transition to labs for students.",4,0,neutral,0
"More questions on the quiz and way more questions on the challenges. The course needs more practical testing as well. What would be nice is if there was case study of some sort at the end of each course to tie everything together. Like a video that incorporates everything we learned.Also a practical exercise that we can participate and for example complete an SOW or meeting agenda or complete an actual sort, calculation and formatting of data. Then in the scenario, what an ideal completed table looks like to compare to.The course is great so far, but more practical experience using these skills is needed to go beyond learning the material but ensuring it really sticks and we are absorbing the material.",4,0,neutral,0
"Ximena - The instructor for this course was trying to speak clearly and very slowly so that everyone can understand her, which is a great thing to do. However, when Ximena had her own ""featured"" video, she was talking much more naturally and I felt like this is how the course should've been.The content of the course in terms of asking questions is great, I imagined and felt situations where some of these questions are going to be useful. However, It is really difficult to do without a dataset or without knowing what an analyst truly does so far. I think I might need to go back to this course after I've finished all of the other courses in this series.",4,0,neutral,0
"Good course but nothing is perfect. I have found a lot of errors in the subtitles. These errors are inconsequential especially if you pay attention. Someone needs to be employed to go through this course and edit it line by line. The software and people are not perfect, so some words that were said unnecessarily get added. It would be fun if the producers poked fun at the software transcription faults and user error (I understand that an academic institution [generally] does not do this). A possible next course of action is to... fix the subtitles or to dub over the spoken words of the speaker or REDO the  videos entirely. Cheers!",4,0,neutral,0
"Learning about the framework for thinking about projects involving data analysis and the types of questions that data analysts need to consider was useful. But for myself, having endured a full business career working for multiple organizations already, there is too much emphasis on the soft skills and diplomacy required for general career success.  This course is geared more towards the business novice who is starting their professional career than for someone who wants to learn the pure mechanics of working with data in any analytics environment. ",4,0,neutral,0
"I<U+200B> found this course a little more challenging than the first course, and am expecting the courses to become increasingly more challenging as I continue.  Some of the definitions learned could have been included with the weekly glossaries to make Google's concept of open-book learning easier.  I found the quizzes challenging and believe that as I continue on to the next course, that concepts have built on each other which should help me move forward. 
Thank you for your instruction, and I look forward to learning more.",4,0,neutral,0
"I am really enjoying the course so far, but the one problem that I keep running into is when I play the videos from wed page they won't finish, or the video will start to jump around. The work around that I do is to download the videos. When I download the video, the video won't perform the review questions, and also doesn't mark the video as being completed. So I have to go back to the video web page and move the video to the questions and then to the end so the progress tracker will mark the video as complete.",4,0,neutral,0
"Some of the concepts are pretty basic, but there is a lot of very useful information. It's easy to breeze past the content you already know and I appreciate that it teaches aspects of the work outside of just technical skills and training. For example this course focuses a lot on how to ask the correct questions and how to deal with communication issues. This is the only data coursework I've seen that somewhat adequately addresses these concepts that make it relevant to the job and not just the academic field.",4,0,neutral,0
"Some of the material seemed targeted at students who have never had a job - basic communication & manners - that's not a bad thing but if you're changing careers or looking for job-specific skills, this course will feel unnecessary.   Also - a couple of the grading results were subjective and (in my opinion) dependent on the situation - making the grading feel arbitrary.    I can easily defend a couple of the answers I missed on the practice quizzes.",4,0,neutral,0
<U+200B>I found this course to be very informative and I loved the pace. Learning moe about the steps and processes of data analytics has been incredibly fulfilling. The only thing I would like to see more of would be some sort of practice section... perhaps a spreadsheet practice board where you could work on fixing errors and adding sums; that type of thing. Other then that I am very satisfied an look forward to moving on through the rest of the courses. ,4,0,neutral,0
"I found the course helpful overall, especially on the different types of questioning and how to ask questions effectively. The information about meetings, although common knowledge was good to brush up on.Not five stars because I’m not sure why spreadsheets were a part of this course. It clearly should be in the next part, prepare data for exploration. Also I feel it jumped back and forth between topics too much, and repeated information.",4,0,neutral,0
"I think this course helps me to think more analytically. Some of the contents are very beneficial if you are going to do SJT tests, behavioural tests, and business case studies. I did not give it five stars because in this course students need to use an extended website to finish some tasks, however, I cannot get my feedback within that website (maybe only me). Overall, it is a very interesting and helpful course. ",4,0,neutral,0
This course taught me a lot about the non technical things surrounding data analysis. The Qwiklabs was a bit odd and I think because I didn't follow exactly what this instructions were caused some issue. I think because of my many years using Excel I hoped over a task and that caused the error. I'm just waiting for the response from support. Otherwise great course in adding to the foundation from course one.,4,0,neutral,0
"I<U+200B> think this course is a really good experience for people who have maybe not had any exposure to a more professional work environment and might need some knowledge on how to approach superiors in the work place. This is also good knowledge on how to conduct yourself professionally. If you have already done this before, then this part of the course might be something you kind of speed through.",4,0,neutral,0
"The Data was good as in the last one. The instructor seemed to know what she was talking about, however. the 3/4 angle in most of the videos really makes it feel like she is not talking to the student and is teaching to a camera. I am aware she is but the last course did not feel this way and it was much easier to stay engaged because it felt like the instructor was talking to you.",4,0,neutral,0
This course was really informative and challenging for me. There were many things that I feel like are a struggle for me such as the communication and asking good questions so that I am making the most of my time as an analyst. I thought the instructor did a good job of breaking down each concept but I will definitely need to come back and review some of the topics and strategies.,4,0,neutral,0
"the instructor is clear but i feel the conversation part was too big a jump to make for a beginner. it was just weird and biased towards people who can get hold of someone who would answer their questions properly. could there not be a mock case study to work on instead? Not everyone has access to people they can just call up to talk, especially in a pandemic situation. ",4,0,neutral,0
"In this course, we explored effective questions and we learned how to use quantitative and qualitative data, metrics and math to connect the dots. We also covered spreadsheet basics, how to apply structured thinking and key communication skills for working with stakeholders and team members. That's a lot guys!, with good explanation and content it's become easier.",4,0,neutral,0
"The course is clean and diverse and well explained. I personally had trouble with almost all of the practice sheets from google. I kept getting the access denied page. I found an error in one of the ""course challenge"" questions. Where it asks for you to determine the sum of sales of a column in a spreadsheet, but the the multiple answer is on a different column. ",4,0,neutral,0
"Very informative concerning the environment in which data analysts work and how they interact within an organization. 4 starts because I timed out learning how to log in to Qwiklabs and couldn't complete my first lab assignment. One comprehensive set of instructions would help. Also, Evan should enunciate instead of swallowing the last half of his sentences.",4,0,neutral,0
"Well designed course covering technical as well as non-technical skills. Markedly more meaningful journal entries from the first course, well-designed course structure and the course challenge. Ximena was especially great as an instructor. But, being an engineer, I wish there were more challenging spreadsheet tasks to tackle than a ungraded Qwiklab.",4,0,neutral,0
"This course was very insightful. I am not sure if it was me moving slowiy, but I am not sure the time frame of completing the the excel assignemnt may not have been enough time. Then again it could just be me, because I had to take the time to go back and forth to the directions. It would be nice if we could print them out to reference to as well. ",4,0,neutral,0
"The course content is great, with many informative videos and readings. The quizzes and assessments are also effective in assessing knowledge based on the concepts taught. However in my opinion, the course structure is messy, especially the sections about spreadsheet functions, formulas, dashboards, etc, which will be explained in future courses.",4,0,neutral,0
Awesome course ! I had a fun learning experience. Thank you. I would like to give you a suggestion in spreadsheet part. You had information on absolute and relative cell reference but it wasn't clear. I had to watch 4 to 5 YouTube videos to make it clear. I hope you add more information to it. Other than that it was a cool experience.,4,0,neutral,0
"While there was a lot of great information and instruction in this course, some of the information is no longer up to date and some of the SQL exercises embedded in the activities did not work as they were supposed to. Also, a lot of the hands on activities got very redundant, asking the same reflection questions over and over. ",4,0,neutral,0
"Love the course. I am learning so much and the format is set up in such a way that makes even a new or seasoned learner able to follow the format. However, I found the discussion forums a bit confusing as to find the answer to a question that was posted a few days earlier. Other than this one issue I am loving the course!",4,0,neutral,0
"I<U+200B> found the course very interesting. It provided many tools and points for discussion, encompassing not just basic technical skills as a refresher but also soft skills such as methods of questioning and working with others. Ximena the course instructor I found to be engaging and enthusiastic about the content.G<U+200B>ood",4,0,neutral,0
"The course is pretty good. The combination of videos, and reading material made the learning process very good. I would prefer to have more hands on with the database and spreadsheets earlier than it was in this course, as I have just finished the second set, and had very little spread sheet practice. ",4,0,neutral,0
"The course covers everything it attempts to.  My only negative statement toward this course relates to the feeling that it is meant to be taught to a ninth grader.  If so, it deserves a fifth star, but if it is meant for a college grad, it gets four stars because it dumbed things down a bit too much.",4,0,neutral,0
"So far not many things are different from the 1st course. Too much talk, too many concepts to remember and not much practical stuff. Everything is like ""imagine a situation where... what would yo do? what would you ask? what do you think about...?"". I hope the next course finally gets more exciting. ",4,0,neutral,0
"This the 2nd course of Google data analytics sertificate is good . It really helped me a lot , in the beginning i could not understand what the course was trying to teach as it got a little difficult for me to understand but after some time i could understand what it was trying to teach",4,0,neutral,0
"A r<U+200B>eally insightfull course about the basic questions which play a big part in making data driven decisions. The material was planned carefully and I didn't felt bored or unmotivated during the course at all, however I feel like the pace of the course could be a little bit faster. ",4,0,neutral,0
"I think at the early stage of this course - like week 1. the instructor in the video didn't always make the terms & definitions clear. She has been using too much verbal language. I loved and enjoyed her teaching, just think this could be something to improve in the future.",4,0,neutral,0
I am really happy with the structure of course. I am amazed that how even little things have taken into mind while structuring the program. how to make polite and formal yet clear communication is a real key while working in team and its explained very well in this course.,4,0,neutral,0
"It has been a great course to follow, I have learnt a lot of things. I just found that too many example are great to explain the situation but actually they cannot give you a clear picture. I would have appreciated more exercises or quizzes instead. But course is great!",4,0,neutral,0
"T<U+200B>he presenter of the first course of this series was much more hyped and enthusiastic, unlike the presenter of this second course, she was clearly exhausted on ""week 2"" and she pronounced the /z/ in words with s like /s/, like: visualize, and it was quite distracting.",4,0,neutral,0
"When working with Qwiklabs there were certain components where I didn't know I was going to do as I wasn't informed of it in any video prior to that assignment, and so it was as though I was being led blind when I did the necessary steps by copying it word for word. ",4,0,neutral,0
<U+200B>I wished more clear explanations on primary and secondary stakeholders because they were new terms for me. And I got bored when talking a lot about communicative skills. Though I agree it was important but I just felt I spent way too much time on learning it here.,4,0,neutral,0
"I<U+200B> loved it, but there a few things that need to be changed. some of the instructions in the lab are very difficult to understand. some of the sentences are covered/ cant see them. that makes it hard to understand the instructions. other than that it's fantastic. ",4,0,neutral,0
"i already have a degree in psychology so most of the technique features of the course are already familar to me. but for someone without that experiance the course should have more empathis on technical challenges, i.e how to use spreadsheets better",4,0,neutral,0

"I learned alot during the course. It still seems a little disconnected between working on a desktop, tablet, and smartphone. It seems the lessons don't update in between those devices. Also, I missed a question on the final quiz of week 4. The question was about asking questions to get proper data from customers. I missed half a point for NOT selecting an option that did not give a definitive answer on whether the customer was satisfied with the vender's services. I thought we needed to ask questions that extended beyond YES or NO. That was my only issue with this course. I feel I should've gotten full credit for the question. I also wanted to make sure that I understand that if I retake a test to get 100, do I get that score, or is my grade docked a couple points because I had to retake the quiz? ",3,0,neutral,0
"I<U+200B> liked how this course is preparing us for the job and what to expect while at it. However, I feel that it was too soon to introduce us to concepts of meeting, behaviour at work environment etc. Moreover, the course instructor's voice (speech) was not clear and felt monotonus most of the time, and her gestures although forthcoming but were too loud and distractive. Furthermore, the video quality on the day 1 of shoot was unpleasing as the colour temperature was set to be too warm which caused eyes strain after a certain time. This however was not a case on the day 2 of shooting where the temperature was nuetral.",3,0,neutral,0
"There is no learning or experience prerequisite <U+200B>for the course so it must be very, very basic, and it is. If you have any business experience or graduated with any type of business, computer, manufacturing, healthcare, etc degree you had courses that addressed the topics covered in this course. I would not call this course a waste of time because it is presenting the material in the Google style. Just realize that you may have seen it before and need to see it in a different way. ",3,0,neutral,0
"Some things were good, and some were bad. Overall I would say that this one was weaker than first. It was off topic sometimes, but I would not say that it was useless. The instructor is lovely and explains everything clean and very understandable. You will learn some basics about Spreadsheets ( I count this as off topic) and how to communicate and analyze stakeholders (would be better if optional). Still, it gave some key concepts and information (like SMART questions)",3,0,neutral,0
"This felt like a basic course that explained the organisational behaviour of data analytics. touching a few important concepts like dealing with a conflict, asking the right questions, and the basics of the spread sheet.It would be more interesting if they have introduced more activities on a spread sheet, handling of dashboards in excel or spread sheet.but anyway it was good exposure. looking forward to the next course.",3,0,neutral,0
"For the information covered, this course videos and text could have been more concise.  There were more words than needed. One perspective within the course that bothers me is how high-level staff e.g. VPs are considered primary stakeholders, while low-level staff e.g. blue-collar workers are not, for projects where the blue-collar worker is key. This reflects a bias against low-level staff in stakeholder assessment. ",3,0,neutral,0
"I<U+200B> had really high hopes for this course, but from what was covered, I have definately already had experience with asking questions, how to write emails, and how to get along with co-workers so this felt very out of place in a data analysis course, I understand those skills are imperative to being on any team, but I don't think they should have been included specifically in Google's data analysis program ",3,0,neutral,0
I think this is a great course and does a wonderful job at breaking things down for all learners. The issue I do not like is that it seems this was rushed to fit the times of the pandemic.

I thought we would be focusing more on asking the right types of questions and how to do so.

"Videos are too short and the explanation is not extensive. Also the study material offers little explanation. Need references to the outside resources to understand the concepts more precisely.

"While this course did provide some useful material, mostly when it was focusing on what sorts of questions to ask during data analysis, I felt that much of it was irrelevant to the specifics of being a data analyst. I am taking this eight-course certificate program not to learn how to work an office job, but to learn how to be a data analyst. Sections focusing on office etiquette are ancillary to that goal, and are irrelevant to the time I am putting in here. I feel that these sections could better be put into a supplemental course rather than a core part of the analytics certificate.Additionally, I struggled some with Ximena's presentation. Many of her examples were not helpful because they were too vague or not rooted in real-life situations, so I could not connect them together or make sense of what I was supposed to be paying attention to. Primarily, she would say things like ""You're in this situation, and you need to do this,"" but I wouldn't have any way to know *why* I should ""do this"" or why I would be in that situation in the first place. By contrast, Sarah's lone video on her specific experiences as a data analyst was very helpful because she walked me, as the viewer, through each step of the process she went on to analyze the data in her situation.Lastly (and this is somewhat unfortunate), Ximena's accent, though not very strong, did make it difficult for me to understand her at times. I found that I had to focus a lot more on the specific words she was saying, which made it harder for me to connect the dots and get to the meaning she was trying to communicate; this wasn't a problem I had with the primary video presenter during the first course (I can't recall his name now). It's possible that I'm alone in this, but that was my experience. I also found her constant encouragement at the end of each video a little off-putting. I am looking for a teacher in these subjects, rather than a cheerleader.",2,0,bad,-1
"This was one of the topics I am very interested about. Unfortunately, I don't think I managed to get the information and insights I was hoping for. The information were too broad, there were not enough real life examples, and I wished there was a way we could really put into practice what we learned in a more interactive way. On another note, something very subjective, it was very hard for me to follow the videos, as in my opinion the presenter was too robotic and I felt like she was reading instead of presenting and really explaining and emphasising some aspects. So I ended up stopping watching the videos and reading the whole course by myself.",2,0,bad,-1
"There are some errors in the quiz questions where a statement is followed by a question mark and then we are asked to ""select all that apply"" - this is unclear and I suggest a rewording of the quiz question. Furthermore, I don't see how learning how to be a good team member has to do with asking questions to make data driven decisions.

"Quite a disappointing and lackluster course, and the title is misleading. Only a small part focuses on asking question and even that part was one-dimensional and biased. Instead of showing different types of questions and angles one dataset can be looked at, we are getting cliche expressions like ""data is everywhere"". Different types of problems weren't properly defined, just illustrated with some random examples. How and if they apply to other industries is hard to say, because we don't even know what they are. This is a real quote from the course: ""Categorizing things involves assigning items to categories. Identifying themes takes those categories a step further by grouping them into broader themes.""Suddenly, probably because they needed to fill the course with content, we move dfrom questions to spreadsheets. Even this part was a mix of basic functions like SUM with more complex IFERROR. I absolutely have no idea how did the creators define the target group. As a cherry on top, the QWIKLABS don't work.

I'm not planning to go into data science specifically, and in the first course, it was presented as one possible way to use data, which some students of this course might choose to pursue. However, the requirement to explore and use Kaggle in this course belies that, indicating that data science is more required than it should have been.

"Again another course that is all over the place. You do learn very little about SQL and a lot of theory and concepts that you could read somewhere in less than 15 minutes. At some point I though ""They are finally teaching some technical skills like SQL"" but all of the sudden they jump to how to organize folders and name files and how to create your LinkedIn account. I am very disappointed with this course so far. I hope the next one they teach something meaningful.  ",1,2,bad,-1
"I absolutely love the diversity in the presenters for each of these courses in the program. The presenters were very knowledgeable but were excellent in breaking down the information in a beginner-friendly manner. There was so much content, but possible to learn and understand. I really loved the interactive lessons that gave the learner the plenty opportunity to practice the new content within each lesson.  I really enjoyed this program that helped me to learn what I needed to learn without feeling overwhelmed. It was also extremely helpful that the design of the new information was always presented in a manner that real-world applications.  ",5,1,good,1

"I think the course itself is a great way to introduce someone to data analysis but it is advertised as you getting a job with the course only which is possible but from the discussion forums I found that most people need to go through extra training form SQL, Python and Excel. I when advertised as someone with no experience can change careers on this course, the 85% of people getting jobs is skewed but the people already in the field just moving up. I would love to see the success of people changing careers and getting a job in data analytics after only going through this course and no extra training. Also, ran into issues in one or the quizzes, where the system was giving out errors and the way it is set up, the only way to get help is through other people in the course, if you're lucky they have the answer if not, you're stuck. The chat was not help since all they did was advice you to check the forum for similar problems. The course is great but should be advertised as what it is, only and introduction into data analytics not a career changed on its own. ",3,1,neutral,0
"A lot of substantive material.  BigQuery account should be automatically included with the relevant lesson.  Why does one need to provide a mobile phone number to set up a BigQuery account?  Alternative services to BigQuery should be prominently listed, not buried at the bottom of the last page.  Lecturers should use better grammar and not frequently say ""THERE'S lots of different ways to collect it,"" when the sentence should be ""THERE ARE lots of ways to collect it.""",3,1,neutral,0
"Definitely aimed at recent high school graduates as ""candy"" and ""ice cream"" companies were their main examples.  Big query didn't work for me.  Despite signing up for the sandbox I received errors that I didn't have permission to access any data.  There are a bunch of attachments to download that aren't even needed to answer the questions so it's irrelevant information and results in wasted time.   Really frustrating.  A lot of the readying was redundant as is mirrored what was said in the previous video.  Additional information with more details in the reading would have been better than the same stuff, just slightly different wording.  Finally, the circular motion repeatedly done with the left hand by the instructor (the only bodily motion at all) was very distracting and annoying. ",1,1,bad,-1
"The hands-on assignments are a dumpster fire and support isn't much better. My BigQuery Applying SQL assignment in the Sandbox looks nothing like the instructions. Maybe the instructions are obsolete. When learners post to the forums asking for prompt (prompt, so we don't fall behind schedule) technical help, replies from staff are unhelpful or ineffectual.

"This course was fantastic! Probably the best one so far, and mainly due to instructor. The instructor was clear, confident and to the point. The whole course was interesting, with lots of practical exercises (QuickLabs, Google Spreadsheets/Excel) and designed for complete novices in Data Analysis in the way which allow you memorize things without much effort (I am sure Google has done it on purpose, probably based on some research on how brain creates new  connection). And I believe this is what modern learning should be like -  fun, engaging, enjoyable and without you even noticing you are learning. I will miss this instructor on the next course...P.S. the only downside is the way they desperately promote Kaggle. At least this is how I felt.  I've also lost two days navigating among links they suggested for learning about ""regexes"" and still don't really get it... I wish they've covered it within a course in plain and understandable way they cover everything. But in overall 5 stars! Really enjoyed it. ",5,0,good,1
"This course was overall well-designed and structured to acquaint the budding data analyst with key tools and knowledge about processing data. The best elements were the less technical elements but the basic use of sorting and filtering data, and organising data repositories are invaluable to working with any quantity of data. There is also a mention of data structures, table relationships and differences between spreadsheets and databases which begin to indicate how data is stored and presented. The most valuable section for me, and which is cleverly introduced at this early stage, was the part about building an online presence as a data analyst. There is a lot of information and guidance on how best to reach out to the online data community, taking on a mentor, and developing an online profile to showcase your work and achivements, that will hold one in good stead in their career advancement.

"I<U+200B> learned a lot from this particular course.  My favorite sessions had to do with BigQuery topics.  I've had some experience with T-SQL, MySql, and Access_SQL (might not be exactly the right name, but it doesn't matter) so BigQuery syntax wasn't a surprise.  I was suprised at the vastness of Google's public datasets.  Wow!  I could spend a lot of time just exploring this collection of data.  For me, the section about MetaData was the most challenging.  I know what Metadata is, but I am still having a tough time relating the terms taught in this course with their specific examples in the real world.  More practice will help I guess.  Thanks for another excellent product Google!",5,0,good,1
"After completing the course the one word came from my mouth ""Awesome"". I like the organization of topics. They also provide the links of articles and websites related to topic. In this course we have learned about the collection of data, SQL quires, spreadsheet functions and formulas, data types, data structure, data modelling, data ethics and many other useful topics. The language used in readings and videos is very simple and easy to understand.

There are plenty of modules to go in the program.Thanks, Google!",5,0,good,1
"Great course to prepare your data. Only one thing might disturb you, which is in third week, it tries to teach you a lot in one video, which can be overwhelming when you watch it for the first time.

The course was great and it was delivered very by the instructor. The practise exercises with hands on activity was very well delivered. The course covered topics related to preparing data for the Data analysis process and it covered topics ranging from data ethics to data handling on spreadsheets and BigQuery. Hallie was great in delivering the contents of the course so well and I thank her a lot for making this course very interesting.  I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is starting their data analytics journey to go with this course. But sometimes the course felt a little stretched and this course might just be a revision for people who are already familiar with the data analysis process.,4,0,neutral,0
"I enjoyed it, but the 'hard' part (BigQuery)  could have been better organised. The videos contain a lot of info that is hard to grasp for newbiews, and they are all bunfled together. Then come readings that give the same info. It would be more useful to group the video and reading related to one topic together.

Similarly, the excercises repeat the same task - which is a good thing, given that for people not familiar with SQL and BigQuery , like me, will surely need to do the same task a few times in order to learn how to do it properly. But this could be made clear: as it is, the number of 'hand-on' activities seems daunting. 

I would suggest restructuring the course to make the learning path more explicit.",4,0,neutral,0
"The course and teaching is awesome, butThe new changes happen in reset deadline is not good, I was in my 1st time line, when i reset, it switching to new timeline and all my previous completed module is not stored in new timeline and they saying to complete again. it not fairsometimes I don't have time to courses and modules on time, so i reset the deadline, but it become hell in learning progress. already raised many tickets regarding on this issue.the putting pressure on ME to complete the course. I love to learn, but sometime i don't have time to learn, i am full time working, i got some free time to learn, putting pressure and the learners make more stressful,PLEASE HELP ON THIS ISSUE",4,0,neutral,0
"I can understand people who are complaining about this course, which is kind of similar to the previous ones. But I like this one better because it introduces some (actually) useful insight about professional social media and connections. The stuff about SQL (BigQuery) was nice too, just not very complex. It seems to me that things go a bit backwards in these courses. They try to motivate you about professional fields and often ask you to imagine what you would do in certain situations as if you were already getting a job anytime soon, when we still know nothing about real or ""tough"" data analysis. But well, maybe in  the next courses the fun stuff finally appears. ",4,0,neutral,0
"Again, this course is a good introduction and overview of preparing data for processing. For those with zero experience, it is a great introduction. If you have previous coding experience, the BigQuery / SQL exercises will be pretty easy. My biggest criticism from this course is that there are no explanations on proper coding syntax/the why of how we code. If you've used R or SAS, coding in BigQuery is very similar. But I kept thinking to myself, if I had no coding prior coding experience to rely on, these exercises would be confusing and difficult. For example, there are no explanations of the DISTINCT, COUNT, or DESC functions and why/how they are used. ",4,0,neutral,0
"Definitely better than second module. Speaker speaks much cleaner; you feel that this stuff will be needed for you in future and also optional part is actually in optional part. You will learn basics of SQL and how to sort/filter in spreadsheets, really starts of Big Query. Get useful ideas and advices for your future. I did not put 5 stars only because it felt like there could be more additional material on SQL and more deep dig into the preparing of data",4,0,neutral,0
"Happy that we are finally getting to the ""work"" of the data analytics piece. All an all this was pretty easy to follow along with. Would like more hands-on examples and that the data provided in the end of course review is used in the questions. It also would be nice to know when something should be followed along with, and when we should be trying to get accounts and/or access to do what the instructor is doing at the same time.",4,0,neutral,0
Pretty good overall.  There was one or two sections that seem to throw me off.  It was the two sections regarding writing code and it was difficult to remember the correct syntax.  I also found the intro to Kaggle a little intimidating.  I also feel that the screen shots and directions on using Google BigQuery need to be updated.  I couldn't find some of the commands during the exercises.  ,4,0,neutral,0
"I enjoyed this course, there was less self-reflection as well. The bias part was truly interesting. I did feel that Kaggle was pushed very much on me and it seemed too advanced. I enjoyed the SQL bit but it was just a bit and I look forward for more. I'm looking to gain practical skills since I am already working for 15+ years but I do see the value in the other topics taught.",4,0,neutral,0
"Course is very precise, nicely explained, covering all the topics from scratch. The best thing I like about this course is the videos are very short and crisp. They don't bore you with long 1-2 hour videos. They have a combination of videos, readings, assignments, practice quiz etc. which makes the course very interesting to learn.",4,0,neutral,0
"I appreciate the course has good content of information to learn and develop.I would like to inform that, spreadsheet security & protection is not explained completely in this course. If these examples are added the course will be more helpful for beginners.Thanks for the support to make process daily with this good information.",4,0,neutral,0
"Great course for beginners and who are confused who to get started and what are the right things to think about while analyzing your data. This course takes a tour of querying data, ethics and security principles that an analyst should follow topped with many analytics community networking tips!",4,0,neutral,0
"When I saw that one needs no experience at all to learn this, I was not convinced! However, with the detailed explanation, it seems that a novice can actually learn it. I've skipped much of the videos due to my work experiences but the videos are definitely detailed.",4,0,neutral,0
"this is wonderful opportunity for me .After 40  yrs i am doing the first course  with google.i wish to get a job in google. i understood each concept clearly. this course changed me alot, i learnt so many new things in this course . i feel very hapy. thanks to all.",4,0,neutral,0
"Bueno el curso pero se torna muy confuso con Kaggle. Sobre esta plataforma uno no llega a comprender que es lo que se quiere que se haga durante el curso con la plataforma ni para que, mucho menos entender el funcionamiento de la misma como se pretende que se haga.",4,0,neutral,0
The course on BigQuery was not very accurate. Even though the site is frequently updated. Following the instruction in the video and getting an error message can be confusing. You don't know if you're making the mistake or if the instructions are not accurate. ,4,0,neutral,0
Its good but not excellent. This course needs a larger emphasis on SQL and less on spreadsheets. I'm not sure how prevalent Google Sheets are in the industry but I bet SQL is a more valuable skill.I did like the soft sills part at the end. Bookmarked.,4,0,neutral,0
"I<U+200B> enjoyed the introduction to technical aspects such as using SQL and joining Kaggle, but found the less technical lessons to be too centered on just defining a few terms, especially since some of the definitions given are questionable.",4,0,neutral,0

On one or two exercises, there were instances where the SQL queries didn't work when I typed them in UNLESS they were without backticks or copy/pasted from the answer sheet, which was confusing.

T<U+200B>he information of prepare data for exploration in this course is really good, the videos are good, easy to understand so why only 1 star. 

I found two things that I don't agree with. Using platforms with free trials and paid versions, in the videos of BigQuery that we use google cloud platform and sandbox and have to use a trial to study. on those videos we use SQL and nothing more, so there is many ways to learn SQL. The second thing was an exam where 3 questions were asked about Kaggle, social networks and what people think about it. It seemed to me that it was like a market study and questions about how we would think it could be better or what is needed. It seems to me that we were helping them with market research and not learning.",1,0,bad,-1

"I was really disappointed with this course.  First of all, we were constantly told that data cleaning is the main function of junior data analysts.  Then why not make sure we can do this function.  I finished the course with no confidence that I could data clean using SQL or spreadsheets.  So here are my suggestions.1.  Less multiple choice questions and more hands on activities.   This course presented a lot of material.  However, there were too few practices.  After every video, there should have been an opportunity to clean  a dataset  using what we just learned.2.  Each weekly challenge should have been a hands on activity to clean a data set using the skills we just were taught.3.  The final course challenge SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE CHOICE. which was totally useless.  Instead it should have  been hands on.  I knew the answers but NOT HOW TO DO THE PROCESS. 4.  For cleaning spreadsheets, I had to go outside of the course and find a free course that took you through the EXCEL spreadsheet cleaning process.  Why should I have to do that?   I still cannot say with any confidence that I can clean data with SQL OR SPREADSHEETS.5.  The resume section should have been at the end of ALL OF the courses and optional.  It was out of place.6.  Please re-consider re-doing this course.  ",2,38,bad,-1
"This course should be renamed to introduction to SQL and spreadsheets instead of Data Cleaning. This course is totally theory with very less hand-ons. I would recommend this course to someone who has no prior experience with Computer Science. This is literally below the CS101 class.

This perfectly encapsulates the biggest issue I've been having with this whole Professional Certificate and Coursera in general: they create a false promise that you're gaining new knowledge and skills, while in reality, you're only touching a surface. This course could have been good if it was a real course, with real teaching and interraction, instead of a prerecorded MOOC. Especially the section about SQL would benefit from it. Would be nice to, you know, actually learn SQL instead of going from 0 to 100 in one lecture where basic and extra-advanced functions were thrown together. Sally's way of teaching doesn't help either, she just kept on saying, I write this here and that there, and the students are supposed to memorize it, I guess.

The content of the course seemed fine and I really did learn some things both in spreadsheets and SQL (of course I was just a beginner in it). The reason for the four stars is that sometimes the BigQuery didn't work (See Discussion for Week 3). In addition, why should we use our accounts when there is QwikLabs? Secondly, the questions asked in the videos aren't challenging enough and the skills needed to answer them using SQL are always the same. That is, they don't follow the actual content of the videos and need just the knowledge from Week 1. Otherwise, for beginners, I think the course was fine.",4,4,neutral,0

"Since Google supplies NO MEANS (or if it exists, it is extremely hard to find) way to give feedback in general about its program re certificates, I'm using this module to do that. The illustrations and especially animation used in ALL these courses are EMBARRASSINGly juvenile. By what criteria were these graphics selected? As a professional illustrator with an MFA and BFA from CalArts and 30+ years in animation for companies throughout the silicon valley, these are an embarrassment. Appendages are often completely out of proportion (and not purposefully - they are just produced by clearly someone who has zero actual skill in illustration), light sources in images are inconsistent, perspective is incorrect, and the animation is not even at the level of execution as beginning animation students in high school. Did you use ANY criteria here at all beyond maybe who someone is sleeping with or just what floated the decision maker's boat that afternoon? Is this program intended for people that are under 10 years old or is the program supposed to be for any age because if your target is adults as well as young adults, you need to either get rid of this infantile poorly done stuff or go back and use actual professional criteria in selecting illustrations AND HAVE A PURPOSE BEYOND DECORATION AND AMUSEMENT for them (go and maybe take your own UX courses to learn why we don't just throw in a cute illustration to make things... cuter...).

"This is one of the most important sections I have completed in the Google Data Analytics Certification to date.

I found using SQL to query in BigQuery to be very useful and think that I will utilise that particular platform for performing my own queries with data in future. Getting the opportunity to practice some basic SQL queries, in order to clean data, is very important for an analyst as most of his/her time will be spent cleaning data prior to analysis. The inclusion of preparing documentation and real-world examples, provides a professional standpoint to all of the work involved in this course.

Some students get caught in the middle of a course reconfiguration. As a result, we lose the results of the quizzes and assignments completed already. This ""catch-up"" puts us closer to a breaching deadlines from the point of disruption, and worse - any affect of the grade negatively, is something the student does not need.

"E<U+200B>ach course improves upon the last. I am enjoying this certificate. Thank you. H<U+200B>ere are some ideas that I think may add value to the course:2. S<U+200B>ince this course is about cleaning data, I feel providing a dataset to clean would be more valuable as a  final course challenge than a multiple choice quiz. It would provide practice, encourage starting to make independent cleaning decisions and be a valuable learning too.  3. My next point is best made with a description. In the Hands On Activity, Week3, we are directed what to do. However, I do not know, for instance, when to decide to use the SELECT DISTINCT statement or the SELECT MIN/MAX statement. Activities like this have been really valuable and I think they would benefit if students could understand more about what to do rather than following instructions. ",4,0,neutral,0
"This is where things got a bit more complex. From the very first video I felt like I cannot speed up the videos anymore, and I have to pay closer attention. But after I got into it, it got easier and easier. The instructor is very genuine and charismatic. Despite the increased complexity however, after you get a hold of SQL, it feels a bit basic. After using one or two functions all the rest follow the same pattern. I would have enjoyed more direct practice of SQL. Maybe a dataset that we could practice on with tons of simple function excersises. After finishing this course I feel like I am more than half-way done, considering that the last course is a project, and the penultimate one is focused on programming.",4,0,neutral,0
"Clean data is essential for flawless data analysis. So, cleaning a dataset before analysis is one of the most important considerations. This course is designed to give basic idea of cleaning process. It has vague information about SQL data cleaning process and some terminologies. If anyone who is new at SQL will get some hard time dealing with it. It is understandable that there are some limitations to improve the content of  SQL in this course. But it could be better. The instructor was great. Her method to interact was amiable.",4,0,neutral,0
"It is an essential part of the program, where you are diving into real problems with real solutions.You receive lot of tips about how to work with SQL and EXCEL.Additionally, you are introduced to new communities, like Kaggle, plenty of options to increase your knowledge out of the formal program.It helps you to create your own Curriculum Vitae and to point out those key elements important to achieve a position as junior analyst. ",4,0,neutral,0
"Quite useful and described the mechanics of cleaning data in detail, although more depth and examples would be useful, especially in SQL. Would also be nice to talk about survey designs or data collection that can minimize the effort in cleaning data (such as limiting codes to 5 spaces). 

Overall a nice course and hope that it can further expand a bit with more examples and useful commands/formulas ",4,0,neutral,0
"The issues covered in this course are important for the preparation of the data to be analyzed. The guidelines for assessing the sufficiency and quality of the data and the tools for data cleaning have been useful. The didactics for the application of some SQL functions is still weak, I'm not sure if I could apply the examples presented to other situations!",4,0,neutral,0
"A<U+200B> lot of information here, but very approachable, even for a beginner. I think the supplemental section related to resume-building and job prep is nice too, especially to refer back to later. Generally speaking, this was put together well, though I would have liked more optional practice exercises with the SQL concepts. ",4,0,neutral,0
"This is a pretty extensive course. I am already familiar with Excel, but I found that section particularly useful. I like the way the SQL QwikLabs are organized with the repetition of commands. Unfortunately, not all of the commands work (UPDATE and DELETE). The big picture with the stored data is also a mystery. ",4,0,neutral,0
"This 4th course helped me in introducing to open datasets and how to use them for data analytics, as a ML student, understanding and learning sheets made me realise how easily data can be cleaned rather than using python of the same task. The introduction the SQL was not that great though, it was pretty basic",4,0,neutral,0
"The SQL part may be organized better. I get that the technicalities are not taken as in other standard courses, but I feel like it's too dispersive. Some section was called ""data cleaning with SQL"" and there was literally no trace at all about data cleaning with SQL.The section about the CV is simply GREAT.",4,0,neutral,0
"Great course in learning how to clean data on spreadsheets and datasets. I now have a good feel on how to approach data cleaning, documentation, and verification. My only suggestion is that during the online cleaning spreadsheet exercise you give a few more examples in Excel in addition to Google Sheets.",4,0,neutral,0
" The course is engaging and if you are new to Spreadsheet and SQL, the presentation of the course will demystify it all. Sally is wonderful and she handled the course with mastery.  Ah, least I forget, are you looking to pivot, in this course it will prepare you for the job market, so no fears.     ",4,0,neutral,0
I found it quite good at walking through the steps and some helpful commands to use while cleaning data. It was also useful to see some common pitfalls that occur when processing data. I would have liked more real-world datasets to see just how messy data can be!,4,0,neutral,0
Course content is very informativeI am not able to practice the BigQuery part for QuickLabs as it is showing no permission warning.Though i have started it for free it is not allowing me to create dataset hence i could not practice properly.Please help. ,4,0,neutral,0
"Good SQL skills, a little too much fluff though, but that may just be because I already have resume experience. Also, I feel like course challenge should be a little harder. But, good next step in continuing to get the certificate overall! 4/5.",4,0,neutral,0
"The material is good, but there were some frustrating technical glitches. The Google Sheets didn't match the UI for some of the data processing in the video and some of the quizzes didn't load all of the details for the questions.  ",4,0,neutral,0
"Some content can be explained in a bit more detail. For example, there's an explanation that SQL can track changes, but how?? Also, it would be best if some of the multiple questions can be checked again for accuracy.  ",4,0,neutral,0
"I learned a lot, but I think it would be better if you made the quizzes/ course challenges more practical. Instead of asking what the learner should do in a particular scenario, make the learner actually do it.  ",4,0,neutral,0

"My least favorite course of the program so far. I realize it's being revamped for early Nov, so it'll (hopefully) be moot at that point. Instructions were not clear, I needed MANY outside sources to finish projects and answer Qs, and what was taught in the class wasn't reflected in the exams, ie it didn't work when I had to use the SQL taught in the class. Super frustrating, considering I thought this would teach me start-to-finish about SQl, and it didn't. Learned a handful of queries with instruction that went WAY too fast, and most of what I learned I had to learn elsewhere. Lots of repetition that was unnecessary.",3,0,neutral,0
"The only reason I am giving a 3 is because I really liked the instructor. She was very natural at it. The course, however, could've been much better. The course / weekly challenges a lot of times feels TOO EASY. For example when asked to write s SQL query, 90% of the query has already been written for us. Basically, there's as little as no chances for us to make a query mistake. How are we supposed to learn if we don't make mistakes??",3,0,neutral,0
"I learned more from this course than the others. It was a good course and covered what I need to learn with lots of practice opportunities. So I liked it! While this course had the most important content of any so far, it was not well laid out. I flagged some lessons and gave feedback. You might get some feedback from people as they go through it.Thanks!",3,0,neutral,0
"T<U+200B>here was a lot repeating and redundancy in the class. Also, several of the quizzes didn't test for relevant or important knowledge. They tested for items that never showed up in the class, showed up later in the class (and thus students could never have been expected to know that yet), or tested more about useless jargon than important concepts.",3,0,neutral,0
"Week 3, 'Transforming Data' first (Optional) exercise Reading: Upload the store transactions dataset into BigQuery. This doesn't work. Error messages. Unable to parse data around Date and Time. Tried three times. I suggest you fix the bug and adjust the material. ",3,0,neutral,0

This course did not teach how to, for example, join to tables, perform a calculation on some lines of one of the tables, enter that as a new column, and output only a selection from all three dependent on the value in a tertiary column.I<U+200B> might mark the coursera charges as fraud after I get my certificate, becuase this course DID NOT teach SQL.",1,0,bad,-1

For an important module that is heavily covered in SQL, it should have been better made. Unfortunately, I will have to redo SQL in a different course to learn better.",2,49,bad,-1

"I'm a little disappointment in the teaching format here - it seems like there should be more structure  and repetition of concepts. I was really discouraged in Week 1 where the Qwiklabs project was totally out of scope for the rest of the Week 1 syllabus - I found myself copying and pasting SQL without any context about meaning. I feel that there should be a whole module of videos about just using some of the Spreadsheet and SQL functions via elementary case studies. I understand everything in the moment and pass the tests, but I don't feel like this necessarily prepares me for the job.",3,35,neutral,0

We did, however, get the copy/past SQL queries, watch presenters write SQL queries, putting more effort in spelling out the name of the database that they were querying than actually explaining the query itself. Oh, yes, and at one of the labs, we did get to see a solution which was incorrect and made no sense.",1,20,bad,-1
"There needs to be a QA review of the quizzes for Course 5.  Some of the quizzes mark correct answers as wrong.  I have literally plugged a formula into a spreadsheet (ie, vlookup section) or tested a SQL query with my own data set and I was able to get the correct answer, but it was marked as wrong on the quiz.  Other quiz questions just didn't make much sense, like a question where a group by clause was supposed to be used but the group by field wasn't included in the select statement.  The errors/inconsistencies are frustrating.  I didn't have these problems with courses 1 - 4.",3,16,neutral,0

"Good information, well delivered. The only thing I don't like are the QwikLabs. They're awkward to get into, and then a lot of the instructions involve cutting and pasting SQL queries rather than learning to type and format them yourself. I try to understand what I've pasted, but in the more complex ones I still have trouble. The course (and earlier ones) should take more time on simpler queries typed in manually before moving on to cutting and pasting for complex queries.",4,11,neutral,0
"This course failed in terms of explaining the more complex SQL queries. The instructor did not explain the logic behind some of her queries, made too many mistakes, and the hands-on assignments were all about copying and pasting. Also, the reflect questions were too repetitive and meaningless.",2,9,bad,-1
Information seemed to be hodgepodge at times.  Oddly put together and had the feeling of being crammed.,2,9,bad,-1
"This is probably the least interesting course in the series so far. It only revolves around more processes to manipulate and clean data without giving insights in actual analysis. I think it wouldbe great if it included some tools for searching for correlations, the differetn types of relationships among variables (linear, logarithmic, exponential, etc.), discussing about correlation and/or causation, etc., two variables relationships and multiple variables relationships, and so on.",3,7,neutral,0

"SQL part was lacking. To use the analogy of chess, you can know how the pieces move, but that's not what learning chess is about, the amount of possibilities to achieve the goal is endless and not all are equally effective.

"Great primer for more complex SQL queries and data processing. I've often just leaned on post-processing data after doing my SQL queries in spreadsheets/python, but with these new tools it should make my processing much more front-loaded!",5,2,good,1
subquery examples were unnecessarily complex. ultimate course design and deliverables were up to the mark no doubt. more detail and easy to understand technical examples would be much appreciated. ,5,2,good,1
This course gives the limited knowledge about SQL.  Some SQL query used in this course is advanced and the instructor write those query without providing enough explanation. And yes this course is great for introducing the process of data analysis but it is needed to take extra SQL course to grasp some of queries. Good part of this course is the instructor was great.,4,2,neutral,0
"This course was very confusing at times. It needs to be edited again, badly. As others have stated in their reviews, the difficulty of this course is significantly higher than that of the first four courses for the certification, but almost needlessly so. A lot of the difficulty stemmed from the fact that many of the SQL statements simply _do not_ work as written in BigQuery, despite the video showing them written and executed in BigQuery.Concepts explained in the later parts of the course are used as part of numerous SQL statements in in the earlier parts of the course without any introduction or explanation. Many of the SQL statements are also used without any explanation at all. This is a great example of showing someone how to do something, but failing to explain why something works the way it does, or why a particular method is used over another option. ",2,2,bad,-1
Needed access to material like the glossary and some spreadsheets as they were locked. Things were not explained as clearly as they were in the other courses. Which made it difficult to take notes and pass the exams. Also had 2 Qwiklabs that wouldn't work properly. I couldn't download the worksheets to do the labs. Not impressed with this course,2,2,bad,-1
"A<U+200B>lthough the instructor is great, I felt like this course less about analysis and much more about learning SQL and spreasheet tools. They are very important, but they are still tools only.

"This course is honestly very weak. It's very inconsistent. The volumes of the videos keep changing between high and low.The instructor jumps from nested SQL queries to very basic function of SUM in spreadsheet in the next video.

Changing the software continuously kills the momentum completely. ",1,2,bad,-1
"T<U+200B>he course challenge was hard but I got an A. I have learned forum posts about the data analyst job market and alleged lack of entry-level jobs are being censored by mods.

"Overall, this was the best one so far since it wasn't all review like some of the first ones were. That's on me because I come into this with some experience and the setup is so you don't have any. However, I can imagine if you don't have any SQL experience this could have been more challenging. There are some hands on activities, but not enough to really get the learner completely comfortable with new syntax and thought processes. ",5,1,good,1
"Course is easy to follow along, but to really get good at it you'll need to set time aside and go through the helpful links they provide you. I've bookmarked them all and grouped them by category (i.e. SQL, BigQuery, etc.). This way they'll be great references later on in your career.",5,1,good,1

"I wish I could give it 4.5 stars. The content got more advanced, but the pace is still reasonable. Sometimes there are stupid questions on the quizzes and even some wrong formulations. I liked the organization (for the most part) and most of the practice. However, sometimes you still don't need to think enough and can copy/paste in too many places. I believe the instructor is knowledgeable, but so far is the driest of them all. Nevertheless, I learned a lot.",4,1,neutral,0
This course was more difficult to follow compared to the other courses (especially some of sql queries). I have previous sql knowledge but i feel like the instructor was doing a lot of complex examples for doing a query for the first time.

"This course provides a solid introduction to intermediate spreadsheet and basic SQL skills.  The instructor is clearly a skilled user of these tools and communicates most concepts and techniques clearly.  Occasionally the instructor while demonstrating a taught technique will use unexplained shortcuts in supporting code.  This makes replication as a novice more difficult.  Supporting information such as https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_count_avg_sum.asp is recommended for students to allow less frustration navigating BigQuery.  Discussion forums are full of students needing help with SQL syntax, case sensitive error, etc.  Responses are understandably slow and an ineffective way of addressing the students need.  This course has some sequencing issues where concepts/techniques required are taught after being required to complete an earlier activity.  The course should make use of the intracourse SQL functionality more frequently and in graduated complexity before introducing the use of BigQuery.  The gates, tested material is too simple to ensure that students have acquired pre-requisite skills before introducing subsequent material.",3,1,neutral,0
"I think the course materials are excellent and relevant, but it didn't do a good job explaining some important concepts, specifically the Subqueries in SQL. Not only did the course fail to explain the relevance and the motivation to initiate subquery, the pace of how different lines do and interact with the core main query way too fast. In addition the time needed to debug the queries to make it work quadrupled at least.  How different commands interact (Count/Group By) is also not adequately explained. Going forward, I think it would be more important to use visualization to explain the different parts of the Queries and how they interact, together to form a complex query on SQL. In the final quiz, the spreadsheet had a bug that prevents SORT function to function properly, with regards to sometime about circular and such. Overall it is a challenging course compare to the previous ones, and I hope they could make it much more clearer when doing these type of analysis. ",3,1,neutral,0

"i will be honest, this course definitely made me feel really disappointed. now i cant judge the whole thing yet since i only just completed week 1, but the quality difference is plain to see. This week 1 feels like it was made without considering what was taught in previous courses- why would you dedicate a whole week into sorting and filtering..?Hopefully i can just storm through this course then go to udemy to learn whatever sql syntax they will teach here+ other stuffEdit: Finished this course, gotta say that while it isnt the best within this google analytics course, it still feels pretty comprehensive and i feel like i learnt alot. granted, stuff like subqueries were just skimmed through and i definitely need to practice more after this, but it is clear the instructor knew her stuff and tried to make her teaching good (i love the intermediate sql pdf that summaries functions taught, although theres none on subqueries)i think i was too harsh on the rating since you know, this is a google course. but overall i think its still a fantastic course and we just need to remind ourselves this isn't the holy grail to data analytics; we still need to learn more outside this",4,0,neutral,0
"This was by far the most difficult module out of the 5 courses I've completed so far....there's a lot of information and new formulas to digest. Quite challenging but totally worth it! I like that the activities set up are walk throughs/ guided formulas to help practice. However, many complex formulas are first sprang on you in a video and then explained much later, so it did feel a bit confusing at times. Would have  been great if there were introductions first to these difficult formulas, then working through threm. Otherwise, I have gained so much knowledge. Totally worth it! My brain cells have definitely expanded!",4,0,neutral,0
"I enjoyed the course but not as much as previous ones. There was a bit of a disconnect between the material being taught and that being tested (taught material was signifiantly harder than the tests). Also, some of the classes could have been scaffolded better with a bit more guidance particularly around nested queries and temporary tables. I only managed to understand this part of the course because I had already completed a Udacity course on SQL. A complete beginner would've been lost.",4,0,neutral,0
This course was well organized and provided loads of great tutorials on using tools for spreadsheets and for SQL. It was a great introductory course for data analysis. My only qualm is that it would make more sense to me to integrate the course project into this stage of the course. It makes much more sense to practice skills for the analysis phase of your final project while we are learning the tools for that analysis. ,4,0,neutral,0
"Course conductor teaching and her knowledge was commendable. But the course teaches with google sheet, assisgnment, tests  that need to be completed for the course, guided instructions are all in google sheet, if you are learning from excel, corresponding instruction are not given, student has  to find on their own. So much  time spent on finding the corresponding options was very frusterating",4,0,neutral,0
"The best course in the whole series, BY FAR. Finally some lecturer with deep knowledge willing to share it, with not-so-easy examples.

I think that this was the first course where I learned something new about both SQL and excel. The program is very slow and up to this point I don't think that I have gotten much out of it.

"Sometimes it is difficult to get BigQuery to work on my mac, I'm not sure if it's user error or operating system.

"The whole specialisation so far (courses 1-5) is just talking without doing. Hands-on experience/practice is really crucial for us to learn and debug our programs. Although labs are provided, it is mostly copy and paste without further explanation. Comparing this to ""Managing Big Data with MySQL"" by Duke University, the latter has more training to hone our SQL skills and learn through practice. I would not have understood the queries if it weren't for my previous encounter with SQL in another course. Also, the learning curve is gradual in the latter, while Google's goes from 0 to 100 quickly. Last but not least, I think Google should have separate courses dedicated to joins and subqueries respectively.

This course kind of disappointed me. Up until now, I was able to keep up with all the concepts, but from now I always feel I need to stop and look for external resources to keep up with so much information. I don't feel the material and the exercises provided are enough.
The instructor and the exercises took a lot of time repeating basic concepts from spreadsheets (such as Sum, Countif, Max, Min, Conditional Formating, etc), while more complex SQL subjects are briefly mentioned. The instructor seems more worried about spelling the FROM clause, than in explaining what the query means. Oh, and by the 5th course, I guess we all have understood what the * means after SELECT. No need to repeat it all over again.
SQL queries became really complex all of a sudden, and Quicklabs are quite useless since they are copy-paste exercises.
Plus, it's extremely annoying that some of the documents we are supposed to use are locked when we try to open them. It's manageable because you can download and upload them to Google Drive, but before you understand this trick, you just keep missing information and exercises. This is happening at least in the last 3 courses.
I also think that some of the videos and readings were not in the right order (a theme appears briefly in a reading as something you are supposed to know yet, and then, after, you watch a video explaining that as it was the first time).",2,0,bad,-1
"Bueno aquí voy, primero el certificado es sumamente aburrido, es en extremo laaaargo, facil, pero tiene muuchos errores, a veces te imposibilitan para avanzar y obtener ptje máximo. Me parece que de todos los cursos el único útil fue el de programación en R, quizas el proyecto final y uno de los obsequios por terminar el certificado, por eso le doy dos estrellas, no tiene sentido pagar por un certificado tan básico y tan largo, creo que hay un teoría útil, que se puede explicar en dos semanas no en 15 semanas, ya que es solo formativa, se olvida al poco tiempo, prefiero un curso mucho mas practico y un poquito mas difícil, le tenia mas fe, me siento defraudado por google al lanzar este certificado ,que siendo honesto, lo único útil para empezar a trabajar como analista realmente es el curso de R y Tableau, el cual este ultimo es reeefome y básico, solo trabaja con tableau public, que prácticamente solo se usa para compartir visualizaciones, en la realidad se usa tableau desktop, como mínimo. Espero que en una próxima oportunidad saquen un certificado mas practico enfocado en la resolución de problemas reales y que si va a durar 8 meses que valga la pena y no le metan una teoría inútil como relleno. Creo que este certificado podría haberse terminado en 3 meses como máximo, peero es tan fome y largo que les advierto, preparense para aburrirse durante 20 semanas.",2,0,bad,-1
"Previous courses on this certificate will waste a lot of your time on 5-10 min videos where they repeat over and over how cool data analysis is,  why the intructor loves it, how and when it changed their lives,  repeat a hundred times the steps to do data analysis, and I could name another 10 (in my opinion) not as important topics that fill the curriculum for the most part, with only little pockets of practical and useful material.   When you finally get to the Analysis course where one would expect to learn something more practical and useful,  the instructor rushes on a few 5 min videos to show you all the things you can do with SQL  using different syntax and functions from what you've been briefly tought before, without any context or explanation on how the query works,  all while making it sound easy. It is very confusing,  frustrating and demotivating in my opinion. It feels like an important and practical part of the certificate doesn't get the attention and detail it needs to prepare us. I am very disappointed overall with the certificate and will not recommend it. ",2,0,bad,-1
"First of all, Thank you Google to give us this great opportunity. I'm not really feel nice to give this uncomfortable opinion. The previous four courses were very perfect. I was surprised that this fifth course was insufficient in many areas. Evaluation questions and the question explanations are not enough. Too much simple and low level or look like just referred from other references. But lectures were especially insufficient. In particular, it was questionable whether the instructor knew properly in the sub-query, when she gives us explanation, didn't look confident. She just read the query she wrote without explaining why and how it is made in that way. I found and learned the contents on the Internet myself cause it was a little far from great approach. I'm a person who handles Excel skillfully and has already learned HTML before. For others, the fifth course seems to need several improvements. I hope it would be for the others to learn this course later. Thank you very much to spend time to read this.",2,0,bad,-1
"I felt this course was rather a hodgepodge of teaching and not in a good way.  On one hand it reviewed very basic spreadsheet info that had been previously covered very thoroughly in earlier courses and yet plowed through quite quickly more advanced SQL queries, terms, and features with barely any explanation.  It felt like here's a rather advanced query with multiple subqueries without really breaking the query down or explaining why or when you would use such a query.  I didn't feel the course adequately taught or directed you towards methods on how to analyze data.  It just gave examples of spreadsheet functions to use and very specific queries to run.  I think the course could have done a lot better with a few large problems like stakeholders are looking for these answers.  Here's our data.  This is one possible way of going through and finding what they are looking for.  Here's an alternative way.",2,0,bad,-1
"I really loved the previous course with Sally, but this one was confusing and not very well thought out at all. I came into this course having already practiced 80% to 90% of the knowledge on spreadsheets and SQL. What I've really struggeled with this course was that examples were given only to show syntax, most of them not even nessecary. Instead of showing a problem, data available, thought process, and application of function, it was instead straight to application of function because this works. I was especially thrown off with the using of GROUP BY directly into an example before any introduction to it at all. Aggregation is supposed to be bee's knees of SQL, but this course was just horiibly messy and terribly executed, by far the worst course so far. I just feel relieved that I've already started learning SQL somewhere else...",2,0,bad,-1
"The instructor was by far one of the worst teachers. She barely explained why she was making the decisions she did. She also didn't explain very well the concepts. That, and there were several times were she needed to be corrected by the people who insert the prompts on the videos. She also kinda assumed we were experts or something, there were times were she did something and then a prompt appeared explaining that she did something one way, however the ""right"" or proper way to do it is another. Man, I was so excited to start this course and it was soo bad, at least for me, I don't think I learned so much. At least you guys gave us the SQL intermediate guide to really understand some concepts.",2,0,bad,-1
"I am a beginner with this material but have experience with data analysis at work. I am half way through now and I am noticing the technical aspect is lacking the more I am into the course: what I am shown on the screen for a query input into BigQuery does not work in BigQuery.  The teaching is alright, but lacks guidance, especially in the SQL material.  I suggest gaining some SQL knowledge before attempting, as it will make it a little smoother.  Other than that, it is alright. I want to find another Data Analyst course and compare the materials and approaches.  That's where I am now.

But this one was not fun at all. I had to ask mentors for help and clarification numerous times and found multiple errors in the curriculum as well. It was almost enough for me to decide I am not going to move forward if the other 3 are anything like this, but I am going to anyway. Thank you for asking :-)",2,0,bad,-1
<U+200B>the instructor goes to fast and treats the students as if we know everything she is talking about. It is too fast paced and advanced compared to what we have been taught in the other courses thats why it kind of feels wrong when she writes these long queries and we basically dont have a clue what she is trying to find. Compared to the last instructor that explained each part of the query this one is really difficult to follow and understand and you just find yourself writinq a query you dont even know how to replicate in another dataset.,2,0,bad,-1
"The drop in producation quality compared to the previous course (Process Data from Dirty to Clean) was noticable and irritating. Nothing major but many small things such as inconsistent audo-levels between videos, numerous instances of errata added postproduction and the pacing of instructor-led ""follow-along"" activites was noticably inconsistent (ranging between low pace to just skimming through details in rapid fire).

It's now finally getting into more complex and technical concepts in SQL and spreadsheets, and it's going super quick! Now is the time to go slow and be thorough, and it's racing through the material and skipping steps in the explanations. It recommends links to lots of other free blogs and websites to 'learn more'.

"Really out of place lesson set. Could be good on it's own or as part of breakout class. Not the best way or time (in the course of this program) to learn R programming. If you haven't programmed before they start with one simple command and then launch fully into it. It's like trying to sip from a firehose. The rest of the courses are on point and have some great information. There's a sad chance that many will get discouraged/pushed away from Data Analytics because of this R course though. Which is weird, some of the presenters even say they worked in analytics for years before they started/needed to use a programming language to go deeper. The people taking this course aren't going to need it immediately and this should be a high level overview more than a deep dive into deeper R. ",1,25,bad,-1
wish they teach python instead of R. python is more beginner-friendly than R. and this practice on R is not hands-on enough,2,16,bad,-1
"This course was where my interest in the entire specialization started to wane. Whereas I flew through the first few courses, eagerly watching videos well into the night, exploring every supplemental reading, and participating in discussions, I had to force myself to stay focused and finish this course. The instructor has little no no personality, and I felt absolutely no connection with her whatsoever.

As far as the content itself, I finished the course with almost a type of resnetment for the R language. I know Google didn't create the language, and my opinions of the language can't be related to this course, but it t is an ugly language, that isn't fun to learn. To me, R is much more complex than it needs to be, and it was difficult to learn. There is little regard to consistant or logical syntax. For example, in most programming languages you make an array typing something like ""array_example = (1,2,3,4)"" but in R you would need to include the letter c, like ""array_example <- c(1,2,3,4). Even using the '=' doesn't follow traditional programming practices, you don't use it to assign variables. Also, some keywords in R are required to be capitalized, while others aren't, for what seems like no reason. When you use packages, you need quotes around the name to install it, but not when you load it, etc.

I also feel there was very little that was actually ""taught"" in this course. There were times in which I felt a topic wasn't explained enough, and other times where I felt like the instructor was repeating the same information over and over on the most basic things. The labs were pretty useless. Some of them were literally just opening the program, typing a command and looking at the screen. Very little insight into anything.

If the instructor did a better job presenting the material, perhaps it would be easier for me to get past these issues I had with learning R. I think if Google feels that learning R is important enough to dedicate an entire course, than it should have been presented better. Otherwise the entire course should be eliminated, or incorporates into a new course that introduces various other software used to analyze data.",2,12,bad,-1

"T<U+200B>he course is a good introduction to R language, but I assume it is a poor choice to make a course fully centered on R in the certificate track. Nowadays, companies focus more on what you can do and not how. As someone who already uses python for the purpose of this course, learning R was just to now it exists. Unlike spreadsheets and SQL, which are kind of universal, R is narrowed towards its own syntax. ",2,11,bad,-1

"This was by far the most difficult course in this certificate program. The questions on the final quiz were not very well explained throughout the course, even when I went back to the suggested video/readings for reference. R was tough, and isn't something that I will be using with my current company, so that may have influenced me not being too interested in it. For a beginner course, I felt R was a little too advanced, because even the Google employees said they weren't using it until years into their role/company. Carrie was, in my opinion, the easiest instructor to follow along with and hold your attention. Final thought, the importing segment should have been first and some things that were covered seemed to be out of order by going deeper as you go, instead of jumping around.",3,6,neutral,0

"Need more focus on data cleaning,  and more hands-on training for better understanding. This course is great but would be better if it included more environments where you need to find and finish the code. Doing this would allow the user to research and apply their fundamental understanding to the code chunk and help with the implementation of the code chunk. Learn and understand the code chunk based on their perspective and learning style. In addition, providing an environment to start and finish a project based on the knowledge acquired after the course challenge; will encourage the student to create, implement, and produce a project based on the information learned. In retrospect of a mini capstone. ",4,0,neutral,0
"this was a challenging course! I really appreciated that the instructor spoke in a clear deliberate manner. The encouragement was also helpful. I felt like I could keep pushing on when I saw that others (even experienced R users) get error messages as well.downside: I ran out out project hours in Rstudio halfway through week 4 and had to sign up using another email. That meant that all the work I had saved on the original account I could not access so that made it tricky when the instructor would tell us to open a file that we previously saved, but I couldn't get to it!",4,0,neutral,0
"This course is very good for a beginner like me, however there are still missing a lot. Also this is a nice source of information for future more advanced study. The one problem which is annoying is that at each practice video they remind you to download pack and install pack. You do not need to do that every time.  A remind to just load pack should be more than enough and the rest of time present more active practice. So I think there is too much repetitive information instead of giving you new information. But at all it is a good course.",4,0,neutral,0
"Although, I was familiar with R following several courses I have taken prior. However, the R Programming course from Google bettered my understanding about R as it begun with the basics which are the foundation to build my skills in R. Now I know why I write certain codes and functions within a syntax. Also, I now see that I could apply R Markdown to my everyday stuff such as making presentations, building reporting templates, building CVs and creating dashboards. This is an awesome experience for me!!!",4,0,neutral,0
"I was very skeptical of this program when I started.  I am so happy I did this. I have learned a new skillset. I learned a lot more then I thought I would and I hope to move on and be one of the sucesful people who completed this course. It was a bit rough with the last part. The sublamental reading was a bit confusing, but I think this is a great program to get your feet wet in the feild of data anylatics. ",4,0,neutral,0
W<U+200B>hile the majority of the course covered a lot of information I did come away with feeling as though not all topics were covered with as much depth as possible.  Virtual learning can be difficult to craft but depth of topic needs to be insured when this approach is the only option.  Perhaps more proof of work is a solution that should be added to this course.  I did feel it was lacking in that regard.,4,0,neutral,0
"This course, similar to the other courses I have done as part of the Data Analytics Certificate series provides an overview of R programming, data analytics process and visualization.  I come away with insights I did not have before around all of the above, and especially using R programming.  It is a lot to take in, which I hope to consolidate as time and opportunity allow.",4,0,neutral,0
"As programming can be complex, I wished we had more hands-on activities focused on importing and filtering data. These two were covered the least yet without them, it is hard to proceed to the next step. Mistakes can be easily made, barring you from proceeding to the next step. More opportunities to practice would be greatly appreciated to help us commit steps to memory. ",4,0,neutral,0
"Unfortunatelly I can't give five stars because the course it is not updated. In the community messages there are a lot of "" yes we have to updated"" but months passed and still not updated. This is not serious, we are making an effort (personal and economic) to deal with it. It's a pity. The rest very good and the trainer very good too. ",4,0,neutral,0
"Especially given that many of the earlier units utilized R Markdown files, I feel like the lessons on R Markdown should have been earlier in the course, and not saved until last.  Otherwise, I feel like this course did an excellent job of providing a foundation in R Programming, and the resources provided were fantastic.",4,0,neutral,0
This course Data Analysis with R Programming was excellent and gave an overall idea for a beginner and the classes and tutorials were awesome. It would be better if some projects are also covered in the course work that focuses on cleaning of null values and manipulation of outliers.,4,0,neutral,0

"I was rather torn on whether to rate this course as 3/5 or 4/5. Large portions of it were quite informative and helpful. At the same time, some very important aspects of R were either glossed over or not well-explained (pipes, I'm looking at you), and later portions of the course felt as if someone had taken the correct order of lessons and randomly jumbled them. Earlier lessons would ask questions that I didn't know the answer to, and then I would find the answer two or three lessons later, in the exact format that had been asked.Additionally, this course could have benefitted from significantly more hands-on, follow-the-presenter material, as well as clear indications of when we would need to have a file (for example) saved from an earlier lesson in order to use in a later lesson. This happened several times, and I was usually left in the cold without anything to use to follow along. The presenter also sometimes skipped steps in her explanation, leaving me uncertain how to replicate the results she got.So, I learned a fair bit about how to get started in R, but the course certainly could have been better put-together. 3/5 stars.",3,0,neutral,0
"I wish the course was longer and there were some more lessons in the hands on programming. I'm stuck now doing my capstone having learner VERY LITTLE about programming with R, for instance, cleaning data is not merely pulling up the names of all the columns in a dataframe. That's just seeing what you're working with, but in the Coursera course that was considered cleaning. I can't do any merging of dataframes, which would have been WILDLY useful. And I realize you can't cover everything, but I feel like Google and Coursera, together, didn't cover enough. This could have been such a fun course, and I was hoping it would have been slightly closer to a boot camp, but it wasn't. Not enough covered. I loved all the other courses (granted I wish ya'll covered more in SQL, BigQuery, and Sheets too) but this one seemed a big like the tip of the iceburg and cutting corners. ",3,0,neutral,0
"Great job at lying down the foundations so well thought out in terms of hierarchy . However, the breadth of material covered in 5 weeks, can be improved. Think of it this way: ANYONE can and will google EVERYTHING as it has become a habit at the current time. One could have googled all commands provided in this course in an hour or two (less than 20 commands covered in this course) and practice probably 10 hours to master them. These commands are pretty self explanatory after all and are independent of one's background. Could have been a lot shorter and more practice oriented.",3,0,neutral,0
This course had a few pitfalls.  When using RStudio Cloud it would not allow the installation of the Penquins packages and also there were no instructiions on how to import an excel or csv file into the RStudio Cloud working directory.  That was frustrating and made it very difficult to do the assignments.   Something I think the course administators should look into.  Overal great course though.,3,0,neutral,0
"This was a great introductory course in R; however it wasn't as comprehensive as other courses that I attended before. Another thing I didn't like is the fact that this was supposed to be the ACT phase of the data analysis process, but we did everything  other than that. It was a repetition of the other phases using R. ",3,0,neutral,0
"I<U+200B> think the information is valuable and the woman presenting it is lovely, but the explaining went too fast, and if it is a course aimed to beginners, we need to know what we're doing, not just  write things and say we will explore it later. I liked R, but will need further training to understand it.",3,0,neutral,0
"The instructor needs to work on being able to prepare us for what she will be doing. At times, she didnt provide clarity on the things she was doing. For example, she would talk about x and y axis in ggplot without first introducing them.",3,0,neutral,0

Copy and past is not really usfull for learning we don't realize that if we use capital letter will lead to an error or many other thinks we must pay attention to. I think giving exercis and let us doing them is the best way of learning, maybe you can put the correct sintax at the end of the excercie in case we can't do it but at least have de oportunity to try.",2,0,bad,-1
The course was rather average in my judgement. It was to foucsed on defentions and not enough on the data syntax.Also the course did not to a good job on layering the learning on top of which was learned in the past videos. P.S please a little less P.C culture.,2,0,bad,-1

"This is NOT Google's fault. But the forum blew up because of  Coursera's decision to stagger start times for the course. I am trying to fast track this, and the fact that I have to wait now is unbelievable. There was NO warning, no mention that this would happen - it was just imposed on us arbitrarily. Why this is a bad policy is because most don't complete purely self directed courses. Completion of these courses is largely determined by a participants' levels of motivation.  Their motivation fluctuates across time. By restricting when people can progress, this makes it harder for the motivated to complete the course. Sometimes, you get ""in the zone"" and are able to learn the material quickly thanks to Google's excellent course content. But, this is contingent on the motivated being able to take on more work during periods of high motivation. Blocking access to classes and forcing people to wait for an arbitrary time only serves to frustrate people and hamper the motivated.  Sorry Google, this class is great but this BS policy is horrible!",1,0,bad,-1

the course is more like Soft Skills Class and less like visualisation class. Theory part is unnecessarily long and practical is too short,1,75,bad,-1
"This course was absolute torture. So much for keeping the audience engaged while telling a compelling story. While courses 2-3-4-5 kept the theory and the tool learning parallel, the designer of this course chose to go for endless rants, with minimum tool training. It's like they did everything possible to NOT show you how to use Tableau. There was only one thorough practical exercise with Tableau; everything else was a never ending succession of videos about art theory. This course should be completely redesigned, and start on week 1 with how to use Tableau, and drop your ""McCandless Method"" wisdom pearls here and there. The quizzes were horribly hard and served no purpose.",1,59,bad,-1
More Tableau exercises will be a good fix for the course,3,35,neutral,0
"Honestly, I did not enjoy this course at all and found myself rushing through most of the content. Overall, it was too long-winded and many points were repetitive. I was expecting more tutorials on creating different types of visuals on Tableau and less on presentation skills. ",2,27,bad,-1
Didn't like it. Too many slides and way too many words/vidz for 4/5 simple concepts.,1,20,bad,-1
"To much less Tableau instruction. The people who are taking the course already know how to prepare a presentation, I suppose. ",2,15,bad,-1
"The instructor irritates me by telling me the same thing all the time.In this course, hardly I learn tableau. If you have not confidence in making dashboards how can you be confident in presenting it.What a person will learn in this course if he enrolled in learning Tableau?",1,15,bad,-1
"A lot of the information about presenting was common sense, but the biggest flaw was the Tableau exercise in Week 3. Tableau Public would not open the .ymb file, so I was unable to complete the exercise. Google needs to update this with a new project that Tableau Public will open. I feel like I missed out on a big part of the course because I could not do this exercise. ",3,14,neutral,0
The Google docs/spreadsheets for the project are all locked. I do not have access to them. I have reported the problem numerous times. It has yet to be fixed nor have I received a response. ,2,13,bad,-1
I learned more about presentations than tableau,2,12,bad,-1
"WORST TEACHER EVER!!!!! The Course had lots of insights. But, the teacher who taught had a very very poor tone of speech and has a habit of diminishing all his last words in every sentence he spoke!! very bad explaining skills ",1,12,bad,-1
"Too repetitive and too much theory with minimal practice on Tableau. I was barely getting started on Tableau and expected more technical details when the course shifted entirely to presentation skills and gave us breathing technique tips! Also, the videos about Tableau were poorly designed and included some errors. Instead of rushing through Tableau, the course should have just introduced the basic concepts regarding presentation and focused on us honing our data visualization skills. ",2,10,bad,-1
"So far this was the most challenging module due to the developed themes.Extremely well craft material leading the apprentice to think and review concepts.I am just a litlle dissapointed because I expected a lot more Tableau practices, including metrics dashboards with real-time updating. Another point is that McCandendless method is galactic and there are some questions in the tests about it. Altough couldn′t find the answers when I reviewied therory.This module is very theorical. For that reason I recommend being strongly focused when studying terms and concepts explained during videos and readings in order to obtain better final results. And in this specific module I suggest to be detail-oriented!    8:-)",4,9,neutral,0
"The structure of this certificate seems very odd. It seems that the more complex the subject matter of a course is, the shorter they made it. This covers a lot of stuff but doesn't go too deep into anything. I think they could have tacked on a few extra weeks of material here. I think right now you have to supplement this course with a lot of other material to get the full picture. ",3,8,neutral,0
"While this course did provide some valuable introductions to data visualization and presentation, on the whole it suffered greatly from one of the same problems that has plagued this whole certificate program: bad questions on the quizzes. Many of the quizzes used questions or details that were barely covered in the videos and readings, or were certainly not emphasized to the degree that they should have been if they were important points to be remembered (as a quiz should be testing a student on). It seemed as if someone unfamiliar with the course material went through the video transcriptions and pulled out random lines, then created questions based on those fragments of text.Additionally, while not being a specific fault of this course but more of depersonalized online learning as a whole, many of the topics in this course are not suitable for answering in a multiple-choice or multiple-answer format. Instead, they should be handled as graded free-response—but that would require teaching manpower that simply isn't available.I have to add that, while Kevin Hartman is undoubtedly a fantastic data analyst (or else he wouldn't be Head of Analytics at Google), he is not a good teacher of the material. He did not seem to have a good grasp of what a student who is completely new to the material would need to know, and in what order. He presented a lot of great ideas and gave many resources, but without much guidance in how to process those resources and use them actively for creating data visualizations or presentations. He also skipped around a lot and did not fully explain what he was doing in numerous videos, such that someone else had to come in later and add notes during the videos to explain where Kevin had gone off to in order for the student to follow along.All told, this course had some value, but rather less than most of the others. Some of that has to do with the inherently more subjective nature of data visualization and presentation, as opposed to previous courses in this certificate program which were based on more concrete and objective topics. However, I do think that the course could have been significantly better.(As a final side note, I was a little weirded out by Kevin's consistent fanboying over ""the McCandless Method"". Some other perspectives might have been nice to have alongside that.)",2,8,bad,-1
"T<U+200B>his was my least favourite of all the courses in the certification. It contained lots of useful information, but was structured in such a way it was difficult to follow the thread. This was particularly ironic, as storytelling and clear communication methods were core to the materials. ",2,6,bad,-1
the worst course I ever did in my life. you have to stop believing that you are the carrier of the truth,1,6,bad,-1
The contents in this course were the worst constructed among all in my opinion. Some of the questions in the exam are subjective and meaninglessly challenging. I would like to have more detailed practices about Tableau or introductions of other Visualization tools. Most of the presentation skills are not necessary in this Certificate Course in my perspective. And please just forget about McCandless Method....,3,5,neutral,0
Additional information around the McCandless' method would have been useful since there were so many questions around it and I couldn't really find the answers in the documentation and presentations.,4,4,neutral,0
"T<U+200B>his module of the course lose the flow and engagement of the previous ones. I feels extremely long and boring. There are lots of  principles of design/thinking/etc to learn, but you never reach that part where you put it all together to materialize your work. There is very little exercises of Tableau.


The  good part is: you are introduce to the McCandless method that is very good. You have to learn that this course, it is way, try to teach you the key points  of communicating something. First, you need to know that  the best way to teach something to someone is to try to use the 5 senses. This way people who is listening to you tend to remember things better.  for presentations, visual and sight. After the senses, you  need to know that people love a good story. That is a good part of the engagement. Last, no matter if is this is related to art, you need  to work with a process, a logic, a structure.",2,4,bad,-1
"Underdelivered. More time is spent on the subtle art of presentation rather than focusing more on using Tableau (70 vs. 30). Not that the soft skill is not important, but the technical skill of using Tableau can be more effectively learned and practice. This is sharp contrast to an earlier coverage of Google Sheets where we were able to practice almost every essential aspect of using it.",2,4,bad,-1

"I was expecting quite more of Tableau in this course, I leave feeling my knowledge in this topic is still very little. There was a lot on making good visual (irrespective of the tool being used) and making presentations, but the Tableau side of this course, which was the star tool to be learned, ended up being a bit dissapointing. ",2,3,bad,-1
"I did not like this course whatsoever. The information about visualization and presentations are excessive (no need to be genius to pick right font and color). At the same time, the crutial skills (Tableau) are given insufficiently.",2,3,bad,-1

"Learning Tableau was challenging but exciting. I can tell it is a very complex and nuanced platform that will require a lot of practice and patience to become proficient at, but the course did a great job of introducing it. I also got the bravery, through the prodding of the course, to take my plunge into power point. Instructor was clear and did a great job stressing the importance of presentation dos and don'ts.",5,2,good,1
This course is suffering in the reviews as it is a change of pace and style from the previous courses.  The time allocated to Tableu is effective but it is only a small component of the material.  A larger element of the course is design considerations and presentation guidelines.  These topics were covered well although again pitched toward introductory learning.  The instructor brings an academic/university theoretical approach at times which differs from the practical focus of previous courses.  At times the assessment material is focussed too heavily on semantic differences and definitions rather than a higher level of conceptual understanding.  Overall I thought the course was well structured and effective.,4,2,neutral,0
"Really hoped there would be more Tableau assignments and hands on exercises. However, I am really grateful that you showed us Tableau public, how to access/download it, and the tutorials that are accessible on their website. ",3,2,neutral,0
Too much repetition of concepts and explanations.,3,2,neutral,0
"This was a pretty frustrating course. I understand certain things need to be repeated and put into context but Google really went overboard here. Some of the test questions were very wordy and confusing compared to the previous courses. As other have mentioned, they under utilize videos and put an emphasis on reading very uninteresting concepts and theories about presentation. Maybe it's because I'm familiar with some of the material that I found it uninteresting and not engaging. I hope Google reassess their approach to this course.",1,2,bad,-1
"Don't go into this course expecting to learn Tableau. Fortunately I had prior Tableau experience but Tableau is only really briefly mentioned and even then the tutorials are rushed. You spend half the course learning how to speak and communicate which is fine, but disappointing that there is such little Tableau practice.",1,2,bad,-1
"This course had some good moments, but the material was very basic and more about presentation skills. The quizes were ""buggy"" and not written very professionally. It could be improved by having an end of class project that used Tabelau and demonstrated proficiency vs just answering basic multiple choice questions. ",1,2,bad,-1
"Too much time spent on basic presentation skills and not enough with using tools like Tableau. That has been my experience with all the courses in this certificate. There is over-explanation of basic concepts, and much less time spent on more in-depth technical skills like SQL, Kaggle, Spreadsheets, and Tableau. ",1,2,bad,-1
"The course is good for, getting tips to make a presentation and how to present it among stakeholders,But, It very little contents on how we could build that visualization in Tableau, all it have , just 2/3 methods to build visuals. It has very little content of Tableau.",1,2,bad,-1

A huge waste of time again. Almost no practical excercises with Tableau.,1,2,bad,-1
"The instruction was excellent, and the curriculum was great!  It alternated among video lectures, hands-on learning, and reading assignments; so it never becomes tedious.  You get the opportunity to learn from several people at Google, including their Director of Analytics; so you really are learning from the experts in the field.The class exceeded my expectations, not only teaching me how to use Tableau (which was my primary goal in taking the class) but also teaching me principles of design AND how to deliver an effective data presentation to stakeholders.  The principles of design equipped me to optimize my data visualizations for any audience, and the presentation skills prepared me to incorporate my data visualizations into a larger data story aimed at resolving real business problems.I can't say enough good things about this course.  I will end with one note about the time it takes to complete the class. If you are working full-time, then you will be able to stay on pace to complete the class in the expected four weeks.  But if you are learning full-time, then the class is doable in 4 days.  You can make it a goal to complete each Week of material in a single day.  Some might say that is too much information in a short period of time, but if you take good notes, bookmark the online resources, and print the other resources; you can reference the information anytime you need when you are creating future visualizations and presentations.",5,1,good,1
"This course was really well done with plenty of practice in tableau and the videos were very informative. I was interesting taking an online course about presentations without being able to get feedback from others on a presentation that we put together, but I think the course still worked well as it was presented.",5,1,good,1

Too little practical exerise. ,3,1,neutral,0
"This course was designed for people who never ever did a presentation before in their life, because the content was almost only theory about how to do a slide presentation. If you do regular presentations in your current job, this course is full of methods and frameworks to describe what common sense, senior colleagues and some practice already taught you. Tableau was only briefly mentioned, and almost no exercises with the tool were made. As in the previous course, you will need to search for external sources and do exercises for yourself, if you want to learn how to use Tableau
The pieces of advice about presentation skills were good enough, and I find the module about preparing for Q&A and how to handle objections somewhat interesting. But I already work with analytics, I've done tons of presentations before, and I'm doing this certificate to develop my skills and learn more about SQL, Tableau, and R. From this perspective, this course was not helpful at all. I found myself playing videos at 1,75x speed because I was hearing the same useless thing for the 3rd time.
I also think that some of the advice about presentations do not apply to all industries. I hope Google redesign this course.",2,1,bad,-1
"This is the one course till now which in some point I felt it has unnecessary content. Most of the course content are like general knowledge, which I think will build up those skills once got into a job. Its like trips and tricks more than a course. Those skills cannot be taught through any course rather than facing and gaining it practically.It focuses very less on the Tableau software which is very essential for creating beautiful visualization. I have learn Tableau again from another e-learning platform.At some point I also felt that some contents are suddenly of too high level to understand. It lacks balancing between teaching.Despites there are some very important points in between to consider which are very helpful.",2,1,bad,-1

I don't understand the relation of some of the questions with the course material.",2,1,bad,-1
"While the introduction to the steps to giving a great presentation are helpful, the description of how to use Tableau is outdated and not very helpful.  Multiple times I had to basically bang on my keyboard to get the steps to work on my own because the speaker's instructions did not align with how Tableau functions.  I ended up with a lot of frustration with this course and did not succeed as much in learning Tableau as I hoped I would.  I will take more time on my own to learn the program and others using more up to date tutorials.  ",2,1,bad,-1
"I had a lot of expectations from this course as designing presentations is something that I usually like. But the lectures were somehow monotonous, the tests were confusing and it really lacked materials on Tableau. The most disappointing part of it, was that it had merely an introduction to Tableau. They kept explaining that designing a good data visualization is key but only taught the minimum on how to use the tool to do so.  ",2,1,bad,-1
I felt like this was the weakest of the courses so far with the most ambiguity regarding the graded assignments. I think a significant amount of the test questions could be updated to be more clearly aligned with the material being presented. I could be an outlier but I personally found this course to be the most confusing and feel the least confident about the material compared to earlier courses in this certification.,2,1,bad,-1
"<U+200B>I found this to be the most difficult class so far in the series. The instructor pushes art theory and speech class examples. We touch on Tableau, but moveat such a speed and are required to purchase a 'free trial' so we may even complete the guided practices. This entire course needs a facelift and shoul either completely deep dive into Tableau or scrap it all together.",2,1,bad,-1
"I don't find this course to be aligned to the level of the rest of the courses of the certification. Apart from a couple of insights about how to structure a presentation, the rest is an endless repetition of the same stuff over and over for ""4 weeks"" of program. The technical part on tableau is insufficient and can be outvalued by any 10-minutes youtube video",2,1,bad,-1
"I<U+200B> hoped to learn more about data visualization with Tableau. Instead the course was more about making a presentation and presenting it, which wasn't as helpful and interesting to me as all the other courses so far. It got quite boring towards the end but I'm looking forward to learn more about Tableau since it seems to be a very interesting tool.",2,1,bad,-1
I would rate this a 1 but I did learn a lot about using tableau.  The quizzes are so difficult because the teacher is teaching the concept of things and the quizzes are super wordy and hard to determine the correct answers. I found myself having to retake the quizzes multiple times.  It was completely frustrating.,2,1,bad,-1
This really didn't go over Tableau as much as i was anticipating. One exercise needed the desktop version that is not available for Chromebooks. For that we should have been provided access to the virtual desktop like for the SQL and Excel  exercises. ,2,1,bad,-1

"I'm giving 1 star to retaliate for having such an annoying certification process. Expect to randomly need to ""verifiy id"" by confirming your name after random courses in the certificate. Want to verify my id before I start, fine. Want to verify at the very end before giving me any of my certifications, fine. Though when I have already confirmed my id, received multiple class certifications for this program, than you want to make me sit here with my thumb in my ass when I put on my todo list [ ] complete class [ ] add certificate to portfolio. Here is a tip: if you want an id verification system to give me my cert, make it a process instead of a random interrupt me and block me from accessing what I pay for until one of your humans verifies that oh shit, his name hasn't changed, why do we need to verify his name for the 6th class cert but not the 5th.

As Connor said, you can have all the insights in the world but if you can't articulate them, it's a waste of everyone's time. Your analysis can be brilliant but it's only smart if it can be crystallized into sensible language that will resonate instantly with your audience. Thanks Kevin and company. It's changed my mindset as to how to artfully sythesize data into insights. It's one of those things that looks easier than it is and reinforces the need to let the overriding question being asked permeate every visual explanation.<U+00A0> I think of a good analyst now as a sort of C3P0 (nerd alert) that can speak all languages but know how to properly adjust complex information into clear bits of insight.

This was the best course I have completed (so far) as part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate but definitely the most rewarding. I was of the belief that I could present well to an audience until I took this course. It has given me so much in terms of technique and planning presentations that I was inspired to spend time enhancing my own ones after learning the methods in this course. I also passed with my lowest score of any course (so far) which just goes to show how much I have learned and still have to learn in this area going forward.

It looks like it s made for juniors at first and it actually is but even after 13 years of work there were concepts here, no brainer ones, that I was not practising..even when I was interviewing for a new job they would have been so useful.

"I<U+200B> was hoping to get more technical skills, and how to actually use Tableau. We created a couple of very very basic dashboards but that was it. I feel like the whole course was more soft skill based, which is good, but not what I anticipated. I wanted more Tableau skills, and less of what to do if I am being nervous in front of my stakeholders.If we stick with soft skills, one interesting skill to learn would have been how to present something technical to stakeholders that don't have much technical expertise. I feel like that is more of a challenge, since the ""knwoledge bias"" you have would be more predominant here. How to facilitate communicated difficult stuff would have been awesome.O<U+200B>n another note, i really liked Connor as a presenter. His voice was confident, pace was very good and he seemed well prepared. Good choice there",4,0,neutral,0
"I have given this course only four stars for a couple of reasons. For me, the instructor was a little dull. However, for non-native English speakers, I'm sure that they will appreciate his slower speech. Although Tableau seems like a great program, I didn't appreciate that we had to download the program. And once you download the free version, you can't save your visualizations on your own computer, but have to save them to the web. The quizzes about Tableau were stupid. As for the final week, I have been teaching the same things for over 15 years, so for me it wasn't that interesting. However, I liked how the information was arranged and Kevin was great at presenting the information. The course was fine, but for me it wasn't a 5-star course.",4,0,neutral,0
"Lectures are comprehensive but dry. Although not hard to follow, the nature of the topic makes it difficult to answer questions which use a large amount of jargons that are only introduced by this lecture. For example, there is a question in which the choices are ""variable,"" ""view,"" ""visual"" and ""value."" Everyone knows what to do given the context of the question, but these choices are so close in terms of meaning that they are like synonyms to each other, making it difficult to make the correct choice. I have been to a lot of professional presentations but these words are sometimes used interchangeably. Should consider redesigning the questions so they are focusing the logic/thought process of data visualization rather than ""nitpicking.""",4,0,neutral,0
"Too much theory about how to make a good presentation. It would be great if the course covers practical cases on how to visualize certain data into a specific type of visualization, and why... Excercises are also mostly about theory and more soft skills. Covering theory and soft skills are great. But it may be better if it's in a separate course.

"T<U+200B>he worst out of all so far. Love the series of courses, thank you Google for creating it, but data visualization course is poorly designed in my opinion. Too much effort is made on linguistics instead of substance and by that I mean not effective communication techniques, but learning the preferred terms to call certain things. Certain quizes will literally give me synonyms for words meaning the same thing, but only one is correct. How does that make me a better visual designer in data analysis? Also, maybe I am bias because I really do not like Tableau and I do not understand why after learning SQL we go straight into the software that is designed to use visual queries instead of SQL so that people who don't know SQL will have easier time using it... Redash and Metabase might be tricky to deploy, but at least with them you use actual SQL to build visualizations, not GUI.",3,0,neutral,0
"There was a great deal of material on presentation skills and how to apply the basics for a good data visualization and I am very greatful for that.  It did allow me to learn more and I am sure that my future presentations will improve significantly.However, I have to say that there are two specific aspects about this course that could definitely be improved.First, it seems like the course material could be condensed to get rid of all the repetition! Practice what you preach kind of recommendation!Second, the sections about Tableau were very confusing. We were supposed to follow along  using a different version of Tableau than the one used in the presentation. I had a lot of issues with that and I even decided that I needed another course on Tableau from another resource. That is quite unfortunate. That is the reason why I gave 3 stars.",3,0,neutral,0
"The weakest course in the program. Clearly, Tableau isn't taught over a few 5 minutes videos watching someone clicking here and there. There is a missed opportunity to give more explanation about BI tools in general, and provide a better fondation in Tableau.Also, this course is definitely different than the other ones in the type of content that is being taught.

Moreover, sometimes useless details were ask in quizzes, such as the shape of tableau tools. ",3,0,neutral,0
"Este nivel en particular no me pareció lo suficientemente extensivo en cuanto al contenido de Tableu.

"I'm not impressed with the course nor the certificate program at this point. The quizzes test your recall of terminology but not your mastery of the topics underlying the terms. There's no opportunity for you to demonstrate what you learn with respect to visualizations and the whole community feels disconnected and aloof. Lots of the forum posts are people phoning in discussion prompts and that's not really their fault; the course phones it in as well. The content is shallow and doesn't foster mastery through practice, repetition, or demonstration. You can click ""complete material"" all the way through the course, guess the answers to the challenges, and get a Google certification in a week. Don't make the mistake of thinking this makes you as good as a Googler data analyst though; this course as taken is blatantly in its beta-testing phase.It would be great if we had graded submissions where we could make our own visualizations, presentations, and show our mastery of data analytics so far. However that would require the Google Career Certificates team to have a team of competent and dedicated proctors and they seem to only have the budget for a couple forum post answerers. They don't have enough people to manage their course or student community.The video lectures have odd pacing and some seem edited for brevity or to support a specific narrative. Lots of the practical video lessons are ""monkey-see, monkey-do"" video tutorials where the instructor demonstrates their expertise and directs the student to follow along. At the end of the lesson, the instructor claims ""now you know how to do X just as well as me."" As if copying them once gives you the same level of mastery.It's not all bad, though. Lots of the principles here give you solid foundations on how to be a quality data analyst. The topics covered here are an excellent jumping off point for independent study and (ironically) googling the terminology used in the course, taking notes, and incorporating it into your knowledge base makes for just as good an education as the Coursera course.Overall, this is a passable course with the potential to be great, but just isn't worth the money I'm putting into it. Since the course is newly created, I feel as though Google is testing the course using the first batches of students. That's a jerk move since I'm getting a bad education in order for future students to pay the same amount and get a better one. It seems like a software strategy for iterative development / sprints / what-have-you. Speaking as a data analyst - this course won't make you a good one. It'll just about give you the bare minimum, but to have a good shot at employment you'd better use this as supplementary learning, buy a book, and do plenty of independent study.",2,0,bad,-1
"There is far too little focus on actually creating visualizations. Too much time is taken up with best practices for presenting, which is wasted on a class where there are no live presentations. I'll keep my notes as reference, but it would be a lot more useful to have ended the class with a decent portfolio of Tableau visualizations. Some of the quiz questions also need to be rewritten -- many of them are either ambiguous or phrased so narrowly that they feel like trick questions. All in all, it's not a bad course, but the emphasis is wrong for the format. ",2,0,bad,-1

More an academic approach to data analysis, although this (sharing) would be a very nice part to throw in some practical guides and real-life hints. ",2,0,bad,-1
I like how much emphasis was given to story telling through data...however Tableau is a really powerful tool and this course hardly touched on it at all.

The fluff about presenting is not exactly what people sign up for when they pay for a data analysis certificate. This entire course needs to be revamped to include more time about using the data vis software. The parts about presentations skills and using slide show software should be optional. Also, the quizes are way too picky. There are bad questions with no good answers. There are bad questions that only accept one answer but offer synonyms as choices.

My notebook looks like 14 people were trying to take notes all at the same time.  Trying to go back through my notes to find one particular command or concept was frustrating.  Once the course starting covering R, it was a little better but still continued to be peppered with extra videos and distractions.  Some of the videos were actually really informative, but how and when they were placed were not helpful to the learning process at all.

After I created my profile in the Coursera Job Platform and searched for Data Analyst jobs in Houston, TX, I found exactly zero! You led me to believe that you had a coalition of potential employers ready to consider new Google Data Analytics Certificate holders. That is one of the main reasons that I signed up for this program. Too bad it was not true. I know that there are plenty of analyst jobs available through the usual job search platforms like Indeed.

"Overall, I thought this course was really good, especially for the value relative to the cost. Coming in, I already had intermediate skills in data analysis, so the first few weeks of the course were a little basic and introductory. I appreciated that there was the option to test out of some of that framework. I was really here for the SQL and R sections, which were new skills for me, as well as to improve my skills in Tableau which were very basic. While I found both these sections were great to form an understanding of the core concepts in SQL, R and Tableau, I don't feel as though I retained enough of the more advanced skills in these areas and would need to supplement in order to be proficient at these skills. I'm also more on the business analyst side and am not super interested in the more technical components, so it's fair to say that there may be others who will pick this up during this time. I would have rather had the course focus only on SQL, vs including R, so that way users could actually learn more advanced functions in SQL. For those just starting out, or for truly building a framework for an entry-level position, I think this course is solid and would highly recommend. But, if you're looking to go a little deeper ",4,2,neutral,0
Thank you and your team!   I found the Data Analytics course informative and useful.   I have already applied some of the tips in my current position when applicable.

Also, the capstone project was quite interesting.I feel that there was a big gap between what ive actually learned from the course and being able to complete the capstone on my own, however, that does force you to find the solution on your own, through the use og googling and forums, which is good and what they teach you, but i didnt walk away with the feeling that ""now i can build on this foundation"", but more like ""i have now little foundation which i will need to add to in order to know just the basics"".

To help me finish the case study I started some free Codecademy lessons and learned more there in a few days than this entire course. I thought at least the job board availability at the end of the course would be worth it, but that is a disappointment as well.

The dataset used for divvy bike was too large for platforms like R. That was the most difficult part of the project. Rstudio would crash multiple times anytime a month that had a lot of entries were used. I was able to complete the coding but after many attempts. I think for the purpose of the capstone maybe using less months of the data would be more useful. I think the amount of data has increased since the beginning of this course which may be why the issue didn't exist before. Otherwise the project was good and definitely had me sharpen my r programming skills. ,4,0,neutral,0
"This course was a strange and wonderful mix of technology and art. This is a great start for anyone interersted in Data Analytics. That said, the technical content on SQL and R is very introductory and very repetitive - it doesn't build enough, and, honestly, doesn't give a solid enough foundation to tackle the capstone. You will have to do a significant amount of learning on your own to be able to complete a worthwhile capstone.",4,0,neutral,0
"its good, can do better on the capstone project, i have been told that most certifications do not add capstone at last but if you are doing, it should be done with a video, just giving out a pdf link for case study in portfolio was not helpful",4,0,neutral,0
"Sometimes I think that the video course are a bit too fast.  The extra readins are goo id you do them.

Really wish there were more challenges or puting everything together before the end. The case study was a really big project for someone who has never been in this field and I feel I would have been more comfortable if there was a smaller practice case study before the final. I feel like you really needed more than the course gave. This course is definitly more of a outline or overview which i expected from reviews but I didnt expect to feel completely lost at the end. ,3,0,neutral,0
"I<U+200B> wish there was more options to Fast-Track through sections. While I liked aspects like Resume/Interview process and Graphic Design, I felt sections were sometimes overly dense. Overall a great course for people wanting an introduction to data analytics and to feel if it is a good career for them. Having an engineering background, I encountered many of the topics prior to the course so I am biased in that regard.",3,0,neutral,0

"E<U+200B>xtremely difficult task to undertake if you are a beginner in Data analytics. The 7 preceding courses guide you step by step through the basics, but the skill level  required  to complete the  capstone project is truly overwhelming and leaves you floundering . Hugely dissatisfied ,especially after feeling so motivated and scoring  99% in the previous courses",1,0,bad,-1
